Education,"Officials, Patriots push for education funding hike",PROMISE Act,7.3,3/23/19,Mary Markos,Boston Herald,9,5,8,"The Joint Committee on Education heard a full day of testimony Friday from the governor, mayors, New England Patriots players, public figures and hundreds of students, parents and teachers asking the state for more money to run public schools. ÒMassachusetts still has one of the worst achievement gaps in the nation between rich and poor students,Ó state Sen. Sonia Chang-Diaz said in her testimony. ÒEverybody knows that money alone wonÕt do it, but we also know that you canÕt do it without money.Ó Chang-Diaz (D-Boston), a past chairman of the education committee, testified on the Education Promise Act, which she filed along with state Reps. Aaron Vega (D-Holyoke) and Mary Keefe (D-Worcester). The bill was one of three major pieces of legislation that the Joint Committee on Education is considering to address the stateÕs school funding formula, which hasnÕt been updated since 1993. Two other bills to address the issue were filed by the vice chairman of the committee, Rep. Paul Tucker (D-Salem), and Gov. Charlie Baker. Baker testified in favor of his education bill Friday, an act to promote equity and excellence in education, along with Secretary of Education Jim Peyser and Commissioner of Elementary and Secondary Education Jeffrey Riley. He pitched the bill as a package working in stride with his budget proposal. ÒIn many communities, we see persistent achievement gaps and missed opportunities for our kids Ñ especially in urban schools with high concentrations of low-income students and English language learners,Ó Baker said. ÒItÕs time to close these achievement gaps and continue to move all our public schools toward true excellence.Ó Baker cited National Assessment of Educational Progress scores, in which black and Hispanic students scored below 220 in fourth-grade reading, while their white peers scored above 240. The national average is 221. Massachusetts overall scores have led the nation for 12 straight years. Though BakerÕs bill would increase the foundation budget by $1.1 billion in current dollars by 2026, his approach was criticized by some who felt the legislation didnÕt go quite far enough. ÒI just think we have to be more aggressive,Ó said Rep. Bud Williams (D-Springfield), a member of the education committee. ÒThere is a lot of subgroups that are really underperforming and I think itÕs not a quick fix. I do think weÕre going to have to make more of an investment and be more aggressive in terms of implementation.Ó Mayor Martin J. Walsh also addressed the importance of education reform. He noted that 43 percent of students in Massachusetts who face multiple challenges including poverty, language barriers, and disability at the same time are in the Boston Public School system. ÒThis formula is complicated, but the issue is not,Ó Walsh said. ÒEvery young person, in every community, deserves a full opportunity to learn, to dream, and to thrive in our 21st-century world.Ó",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Education,"How much is enough? Lawmakers, governor clash over changes to school funding formula",PROMISE Act,6.7,3/23/19,Victoria McGrane,Boston Globe,10,5,5,"In this year's first major hearing in the debate over education funding on Beacon Hill, dozens of mayors, teachers, school officials, and even a quartet of New England Patriots players urged lawmakers to boost aid to urban districts struggling with growing populations of high-need students and steep budget cuts.Brockton School Superintendent Kathleen A. Smith captured the argument of those demanding an overhaul of the stateÕs school funding formula, telling lawmakers that her city in 2017 spent just $1 on supplies per student, while wealthy Weston spent $275 per pupil. ÒI am saddened and dismayed that after five years of coming before you more than a dozen times to advocate for our neediest students, I am once again asking you to act and update a 25-year-old funding formula that is broken and no longer serves the needs of the increasingly diverse student population in our Commonwealth,Ó Smith, whose district has been contemplating a lawsuit over school funding, told members of the LegislatureÕs joint committee on education during a packed hearing Friday.All of Beacon HillÕs top leaders say they want to pass education funding legislation this year, and FridayÕs hearing, called early in the LegislatureÕs session, is the latest sign they intend to tackle one of the most controversial issues in the state. But the daylong hearing also exposed the fault lines that run through the debate. While everyone, from Governor Charlie Baker on down, agreed the state needs to overhaul the education formula and boost funding for struggling urban school districts, thereÕs not yet consensus on just how much more money the state should commit, and what other requirements should accompany that new cash to ensure itÕs actually being used in ways that will help student performance. Several members of the education committee made clear they believed BakerÕs proposal, which he introduced earlier this year, does not do enough. ÒI think we need to be more aggressive,Ó Representative Bud L. Williams of Springfield told Baker. BakerÕs plan would increase the stateÕs so-called foundation budget, the complicated formula that determines the minimum cost to provide an adequate education for students, by $1.1_billion at the end of a seven-year phase-in period. But that $1.1_billion figure includes increased contributions from local districts as well as from the state. The SenateÕs education committee chairman, Jason Lewis, said the Baker bill would increase state aid by about $500_million when fully implemented. A 2015 panel charged with looking at the funding formula urged the state to spend at least $1_billion more. A competing bill sponsored by Senator Sonia Chang-D’az proposed increasing state spending Ònorth of $1_billion,Ó she said Friday. Plus, critics charge, a portion of the increased spending Baker counts in his proposal would happen under current law regardless of what happens on Beacon Hill, because spending would go up via inflation. ÒYouÕre taking credit for numbers that would be increasing anyway,Ó Senator Adam G. Hinds told Education Secretary James Peyser, prompting noises of agreement from an audience packed with supporters of the Chang-Diaz bill who wore red T-shirts. Patriots players Devin McCourty, Jason McCourty, Matthew Slater, and Duron Harmon all testified in favor of the Chang-Diaz bill, known as the Promise Act. Baker indicated heÕd want to see more policy strings attached to state aid if lawmakers decide to pass legislation that would dramatically increase the stateÕs share of education funding. ÒIf people want to pursue a more aggressive strategy . . . and dramatically amp up the stateÕs share, I think we need to have a whole new conversation about accountability because then you really are talking about the state becoming the primary funder of K-12 education in Massachusetts,Ó he told the lawmakers. But if BakerÕs bill is seen as too little by some lawmakers, the hearing underscored that the Chang-D’az bill is seen by others as going too far. A key difference in the two bills is how much each would boost funding for low-income students. The Chang-D’az bill would ultimately send the districts with the highest concentration of poor students an additional $4,600 per low-income student. The Baker bill would give those districts about $470 more per low-income student, according to a legislative analysis. There is also a House bill on the table, introduced by Representative Paul Tucker, but advocates say it doesnÕt contain enough detail Ñ particularly on how much more should be spent on low-income students Ñ to compare it to the other two bills. Representative Alice Peisch, the House education committee chair, openly challenged the Chang-D’az bill. Directing a question to Representative Aaron Vega of Holyoke, a lead sponsor of the bill, Peisch questioned the wisdom of provisions in the bill that would send Òsubstantial fundingÓ to districts that already have high per-pupil spending. While she did not name it, PeischÕs comments appeared to be directed at Boston, which would benefit from a provision in the Promise Act that changes how the school funding formula accounts for charter school tuition reimbursements. The change would guarantee that Boston and other districts with a large numbers of students attending charter schools would get a minimum level of state aid for the students that remain in the district; currently most of BostonÕs state aid gets redirected to charter schools Boston students attend. ÒWe only have so much money regardless of where we land,Ó said Peisch. ÒMy concern is any dollar that goes to a city other than a gateway city is one that doesnÕt get to a gateway city.Ó In his testimony, Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh defended the cityÕs position that it, too, needs more money from the state, citing the high proportion of poor students and students of color it serves. ÒItÕs not a handout, itÕs a partnership embedded in our stateÕs constitution,Ó he said. But critics say the Promise Act provision is tantamount to having the state give the city money for students it is not educating. PeyserÕs office estimates that, fully implemented, the charter-related provision would mean roughly $75 million more in state aid for Boston each year, and a total of about $153 million more going to districts with charter school students. BakerÕs bill addresses this issue differently and would give Boston about $16.5 million more than current law. Chang-D’az pushed back, reminding Peisch that the state sends a minimum level of aid to even the very wealthiest districts, many of which have few if any poor or other high-needs students. ÒIf weÕre going to continue to do that, then we also need to make sure we are meeting minimum benchmarksÓ in the state partnership with local municipalities, she said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Education,Statehouse Hearing To Highlight Education Funding Fight,PROMISE Act,7.3,3/23/19,Bob Salsberg,WBUR,9,5,8,"State officials and legislative leaders sounded an optimistic tone Friday that a long-sought overhaul of the education funding formula to help Massachusetts' neediest children was close on the horizon. Yet there was still no immediate indication that a consensus, which has eluded the political establishment for years, was closer to realization. Mayors, educators, parents and students jammed a Statehouse auditorium for a public hearing on education spending proposals. Several New England Patriots players brought star power to the daylong event, urging the Legislature's Education Committee to direct more money to vital school programs. A 2015 report from a special commission determined that the school spending formula created under a landmark 1993 education reform law had become outdated and was underfunding school districts by $1 billion to $2 billion annually. Bearing the brunt of that shortfall were low-income, minority and immigrant students, widening gulfs in academic performance between students from wealthier communities and many of their less-advantaged urban counterparts. Despite broad agreement that a revamp of the formula was needed, negotiations between the House and Senate collapsed in the closing hours of the legislative session last year. The issue quickly re-emerged when the new session opened in January. Republican Gov. Charlie Baker told lawmakers the 1993 law had, in fact, played a vital role in Massachusetts students attaining some of the highest overall test scores in the nation. ""Unfortunately, this success has not been shared by all communities and all students at an equal pace,"" Baker said. ""In many communities, we see persistent achievement gaps and missed opportunities for our kids, especially in urban schools with high concentrations of low-income students and English language learners."" Baker appealed for passage of a bill he filed to address key concerns about the formula, including that it failed to properly factor in costs for special education and students learning to speak English, and for increases in health care costs for school districts. The bill would provide $1.1 billion in additional education funding split between the state and local communities over the next seven years, ""and we can do it without raising taxes,"" the governor said. The administration has emphasized that educational disparities won't be solved simply through additional spending, and that more accountability is needed for failing school districts. Many advocates who contend Baker's proposal would provide too little state funding and take too long a period to implement have lined up behind a competing measure filed by a group of liberal Democratic legislators. ""Everyone knows money alone won't do it, but we also know that you can't do it without money,"" said Boston Democrat Sonia Chang-Diaz, the bill's chief Senate sponsor. Rep. Aaron Vega, a Holyoke Democrat who is leading the House efforts on the bill, said that the measure was roughly 70 percent the same as Baker's legislation, but that the 30 percent where they differ is where most of the money is concentrated. Under questioning by committee Democrats, state Education Secretary James Peyser said the administration's funding proposal a starting point that was not ""chiseled in stone."" While the Democrats' proposal specifies neither a funding amount not timetable for implementation, backers strongly suggest that the state alone must contribute more than $1 billion and that changes to the formula must happen sooner to assure current students benefit. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, noting that 86 percent of the city's public school students were minorities and that many face poverty, language barriers and disabilities, joined other mayors in urging state leaders to put politics aside, ""so we can stop pitting city against town, district against charter, legislator against legislator, and start meeting all our students' and communities' needs."" Patriots star Devin McCourty told the panel he had visited many Massachusetts schools during his career and was dismayed by the number of black and Latino students reading below grade level. He and teammates Jason McCourty, Duron Harmon and Matthew Slater are members of the Players Coalition, current and former NFL players promoting social justice issues. ""Our goal today is to lend our voices to thousands of children, in particular impoverished children of color, who need all of our help,"" Slater said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Economic Mobility,Benjamin Franklin Institute joins Boston program that offers free college tuition to BPS grads,Community College,9.0,3/21/19,Annika Hom,Boston Globe,10,9,8,"The Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology has become the latest local college to join a city program that offers low-income Boston public school graduates free tuition, Mayor Martin J. Walsh announced Wednesday. The Tuition-Free Community College program lets students attend the partnering colleges at no cost if they maintain a 2.0 grade point average and enroll a year after obtaining their GED. At a news conference at the South End school, students praised the partnership. Helida Mondrond, a Dorchester resident and a senior at Jeremiah E. Burke High School, said a free associateÕs degree would help her family immensely. She already takes classes at Benjamin Franklin through its dual enrollment program, and next year sheÕd be among the first cohort to benefit from the deal. ÒI feel happy I donÕt have to work all day,Ó Mondrond said. ÒI had to work to pay for scholarships. My father has three kids, so itÕs going to be hard for him. HeÕd like for all of us to do college.Ó Anthony Benoit, the president of the institute, said: ÒThe average student who comes here comes from a background of very low income. ItÕs really a huge step forward. This program will make this opportunity available to more people.Ó The program kicks off this fall and is open to both current students and incoming students. It will be funded by the Neighborhood Jobs Trust, which collects linkage fees on large commercial developments in Boston. The free college program aims to help people with diverse and low-socioeconomic backgrounds. Benjamin Franklin says 93 percent of its students receive federal aid. ÒOne way of addressing these issues is by making sure people have opportunity to education and good paying jobs,Ó Walsh said. Benjamin Franklin, founded in 1908, is a small, private nonprofit college that focuses on technical career education. In January, the school announced plans to sell its century-old building and look for a new modern campus in Boston. The college is the fourth overall and the first private school to join the program, which was launched in 2016. Other participants are Bunker Hill Community College, Roxbury Community College, and MassBay Community College. There are 316 participants in the program to date. Walsh said he hopes the program will expand statewide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Housing,Boston Planning & Development Agency Approves 717 New Residential Units,Linkage/IDP,5.0,3/19/19,,Boston Real Estate Times,2,5,8,"The Boston Planning & Development Agency (BPDA) Board of Directors approved development projects in neighborhoods across the City of Boston which will result in hundreds of market-rate and income-restricted residential units, economic development, and jobs.

Housing,It's Time to Act on Housing,"Tenant's Right of Refusal, Right to Counsel, Linkage/IDP,  CPA",8.0,3/15/19,Joseph Kriesberg and Vanessa Calderon-Rosado,Commonwealth Magazine,5,9,10,"THE 347 FAMILIES living in the Fairlawn apartments in Mattapan have good reason to be scared. Last year, when the owner put the property on the market, city officials worked with a well-respected non-profit developer with the intent to buy the building and keep it affordable for the residents. Instead, the owner sold the building to an affiliate of The DSF Group of Waltham for $65 million Ð the same price offered by the non-profit. The property rents have already started to go up $200 to $300. This is not an isolated story. Hard working families across the Commonwealth are receiving eviction notices as rents increase. Every day investors outbid families by offering cash to sellers seeking to capitalize on todayÕs high home prices. Every day the problem gets worse and we lose opportunities to address the crisis. The time for action is now. Thankfully, Mayor Marty Walsh has proposed an ambitious housing policy platform designed to create 16,000 net new affordable homes in Boston by 2030. Simultaneously, Gov. Charlie Baker and several legislative leaders have put forward proposals to address this challenge statewide.  Together, these proposals can help advance what we call a Four-Step Agenda for alleviating the housing crisis.
Step One Ð Protect tenants facing eviction and displacement Mayor Walsh has proposed legislation to prevent circumstances like the Fairlawn sale by giving tenants the right to partner with a developer to purchase their own buildings when owners put them up for sale. Modeled after existing Massachusetts laws that apply to subsidized housing and mobile home parks, this law would help retain apartments for working-class families and seniors. Tenants would have to match offers from other potential buyers, ensuring that owners would receive a fair price and tenants would not be displaced. The mayor also has proposed legislation granting every low-income tenant in Massachusetts the right to legal counsel when facing an eviction. Currently, landlords almost always have an attorney, while tenants rarely do. This imbalance yields predictable results. Step Two Ð Secure new revenue to fund affordable housing Compared to the 40 percent dedicated to health care, only one percent of the stateÕs operating budget goes towards housing, even though poor housing is one of the key social factors undermining good health. To address this disparity, the mayor has proposed legislation to strengthen the cityÕs linkage program, which requires commercial developers to contribute funds toward affordable housing and job training. The mayor also wants to incorporate the successful inclusionary development program into the cityÕs zoning ordinance to ensure that all new housing developments include affordable units. Finally, Mayor Walsh is joining a statewide coalition to increase the stateÕs contribution to the Community Preservation Act. These actions move the needle in Boston, but we also need new revenue sources Ð both operating dollars from the state budget and capital dollars Ð to dramatically expand the supply of affordable rental and homeownership opportunities across the Commonwealth. Step Three Ð Fix our zoning and land use laws so we can expand housing opportunities
Comprehensive zoning reform makes it easier for municipalities to build new housing (as proposed in Gov. BakerÕs Housing Choice bill) and creates the incentives and penalties necessary to ensure that other communities add new housing, especially multifamily in smart growth locations. Thankfully, there are promising bills now pending in the State House that would do just that. Step Four Ð Restore abandoned and poor-quality housing in weak housing markets While much of our state faces rapidly rising home prices, Gateway Cities and rural communities struggle with weak real estate markets, where low rents and declining values make it difficult to maintain an aging housing stock. Rep. Antonio Cabral and Sen. Brendan Crighton have filed legislation calling for an ambitious neighborhood stabilization initiative to put older properties back to use, thereby taking market pressure away from neighborhoods facing gentrification.

We urge leaders in local and state government to take additional steps to address the housing crisis facing these areas. Now is the time to enact a comprehensive four-step housing agenda that protects tenants, generates revenue for affordable housing, expands housing opportunities, and restores hope to struggling communities. As our neighbors in Mattapan can attest, we canÕt wait any longer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Transportation,Osgood Details Mayor's Transportation Initiatives,Regional Transport Ballot Initiatives,7.0,3/12/19,Bruce Mohl,Commonwealth Magazine,5,8,8,"BOSTON MAYOR MARTY WALSH made a splash last week by announcing a bunch of new transportation initiatives, some of which were set in motion by the advocacy of Boston City Councilor Michelle Wu. In a speech to the annual meeting of the Boston Municipal Research Bureau on Thursday, Walsh called for reducing the speed limit on neighborhood streets to 20 miles per hour, providing free T passes to every Boston student at public and private schools in grades 7 through 12, creating two new dedicated bus lane pilots, and testing a new pickup-dropoff spot for ride hailing apps such as Uber and Lyft at the intersection of Boylston and Kilmarnock Streets in the Fenway.

On the Codcast with Josh Fairchild and James Aloisi of TransitMatters, Chris Osgood, WalshÕs chief of streets, detailed the proposals and said a major goal of the cityÕs new transit team will be to accelerate these types of initiatives. The team currently has two members focused on planning and engineering, but Osgood said it will be expanded to six.
Osgood also outlined the mayorÕs legislative goals Ð one bill allowing regional ballot tax initiatives to raise money for specific transportation projects and another bill placing higher assessments on ride-hailing apps such as Uber and Lyft, which Osgood indicated are taking over the streets of Boston.

ÒWhat weÕre all struck by is just the volume of Uber and Lyft rides, and TNC rides in general,Ó Osgood said. ÒI think it was 35 million [rides] started in the city of Boston in 2017, which is about 96,000 a day Ð more passengers than take the Blue Line on an average weekday. ItÕs just a huge number of people who are taking Uber and Lyft, which underscores the role [ride hailing apps] play in the mobility options in this region.Ó

WuÕs name came up only once during the discussion of WalshÕs initiatives, but some of the transportation measures owe a lot of their momentum to the Boston city councilor.
The push for every student to receive a free T pass, for example, gained momentum when survey research conducted by WuÕs office found the existing pass program Ð which excludes students who live less than two miles from their school Ð is discriminatory.

ÒIt essentially creates two classes of students,Ó the research report said. ÒOne class of students is afforded not only more options to get to school, but also the ability to travel around the city for free during the school year. The other class of students may have to walk up to two miles to get to school and has to constantly consider public transit costs in all their activity choices.Ó

Dedicated bus lane pilots have become a high priority for the MBTA, and Wu has helped dramatize the need for them through personal advocacy on behalf of the only dedicated lane in operation now Ð running down Washington Street in Roslindale.

There are also areas where Wu and the mayor disagree. Wu favors charging for residential parking permits, but Walsh opposes that idea. Osgood said the mayor has focused on using parking meter rates and fines to influence the way people use city streets. ÒIn some ways, those two levers are much closer to the way people use city streets than residential parking permits,Ó Osgood said.

Wu has also led the fight against the MBTAÕs proposed 6.3 percent average fare hike, assembling a petition urging the transit agency to leave fares alone and to  embrace congestion pricing and higher fees on ride-hailing apps, both of which have won some support on the MBTAÕs Fiscal and Management Control Board. She has also come out in support of free fares for everyone. Walsh, as Osgood points out, is worried about the decrease in ridership a fare increase might cause. ÒSo part of what the mayor has been pushing is to make sure that the MBTA is showing, if thereÕs going to be an increase, tell us how youÕre going to spend that revenue so we understand that weÕre not simply getting fewer riders, weÕre actually going to get better service,Ó he said. Osgood also said the mayor wants to see young and old riders shielded from any increases.
Osgood indicated the mayor was not ready to embrace congestion pricing, which would require legislative action. He said Walsh would prefer to focus on issues the city can control to improve traffic flow, such as parking fines and parking meter rates. He said the mayor also believes expanded commuter rail service will reduce congestion. ÒHigh quality all-day service Ð higher frequency service Ð on commuter rail is essential,Ó Osgood said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Economic Mobility,Investing in Tourism and the Arts Boosts Mass. Economy,Tourism Commission,9.7,3/11/19,Martha Sheridan and Lee Pelton,Boston Globe,10,9,10,"MASSACHUSETTSÕ DYNAMIC tourism industry and its arts and cultural assets are inextricably linked, collectively delivering extraordinary dividends to the stateÕs economic vitality and quality of life. Residents and visitors alike reap the benefits created by these sectors, and yet there is no predictable or dedicated financial support on the state and local level to ensure their sustainability, or even their survival.

With Boston Mayor Martin J. WalshÕs proposal for a special commission led by the state Executive Office of Economic Development to evaluate tourism and arts funding, Massachusetts officials and tourism partners can take a fresh look at the profound impact these sectors have on the Boston and Massachusetts economy. This important commission would examine the current state of funding for these sectors in the Commonwealth, and the success of various programs, and compare them to other statesÕ efforts.  The commission would hold meetings and public hearings over the next year and deliver its findings a year after it convenes. The commission would represent all of Massachusetts and stimulate a conversation on how we invest in and leverage our unrivaled qualities. And this investment will bear fruit, for when visitors come to Massachusetts to experience the city, its cultural treasures, and vibrant arts scene, their expenditures generate tax dollars that support the infrastructure and citizenry of Massachusetts without taxing its constituents. Investment in tourism and the arts is a no-brainer, and the creation of this commission is a tremendous first step to initiate a statewide discussion based on that premise. The commission would also look at how to build a stronger pipeline to jobs in the tourism and arts and culture economies, which collectively employ more than 175,000 statewide.

As the CommonwealthÕs third largest industry, tourism contributes more than $20 billion annually in direct spending alone. More than 27 million annual visitors sustain an industry that supports nearly 150,000 jobs statewide.

It is therefore unfortunate that the tourism industry has perpetually dealt with uncertainty over funding.  Taxes are levied on hotel stays at a much higher rate than traditional goods and services. However, very little of the revenue generated from the occupancy tax is reinvested in the industry, as was originally intended. In fact, Massachusetts ranks near the bottom of all 50 states in terms of destination marketing budgets on the state and regional levels. While New York, Florida, and California allocate between $50-$120 million per year in tourism marketing dollars on the state level, and the average US state spends approximately $20 million, Massachusetts allocates a mere $10 million to be divvied up between the state tourism office and 16 regional tourism councils. As the largest tourism council, the Greater Boston Convention & Visitors Bureau receives more funding than the others, but the fact that Boston, a top-tier city, has no direct access to occupancy tax revenue, and no consistent notion of how much annual funding it will receive for destination marketing, is baffling for those who work in the industry.
Massachusetts also boasts a robust arts and culture sector: regional arts and cultural organizations directly inject nearly $1 billion into the local economy each year, providing 26,000 jobs. An ArtsBoston study found that Greater Boston is home to more arts and cultural organizations, per capita, than any other metropolitan area in the country. When it comes to dedicated funding, however, the arts and culture sector fares no better than tourism, which is symptomatic of the bigger picture in which Massachusetts is failing to invest in some of its essential resources, including cultural tourism. Massachusetts currently lacks a comprehensive and coordinated plan to support these vital institutions, most of which are non-profit.  Instead, these institutions rely on dwindling corporate support and private donors to bridge the gap between ticket revenue and the high cost of staging performances, events, and exhibits, or they simply foot the bill themselves.

As one example, Emerson College has invested over $600 million to revitalize downtown Boston and the arts institutions located there, and the collegeÕs efforts to restore historic buildings and theatres have sparked an economic and cultural renaissance in an area of the city that was once forgotten.  Emerson, which owns more performance space than any other Boston institution, is proud of this commitment and its arts stewardship, but public support for the arts and cultural tourism is urgently needed to continue this momentum.

Indeed, the arts are powerful economic engines that contribute significantly to our local and regional economy, and to the entrepreneurial culture for which Boston has become so well known. And far beyond the obvious pocketbook issues, the arts contribute to quality of life, attract a creative workforce, and have the capacity to inspire, embrace, and celebrate the cityÕs emerging diversity by bringing people together. Despite the extraordinary cultural, historical, and natural assets that make Massachusetts a top destination, without deep investment in the arts, culture, and tourism sectors we risk losing so much more than market share to other states. We risk losing the qualities that make our Commonwealth a leader and model for the rest of our country.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Education,Marty Walsh: 'Not Satisfied' with Progress Surrounding Education,PROMISE Act,9.0,3/8/19,Brooks Sutherland,Boston Herald,9,9,9,"Mayor Martin J. Walsh said his administration has worked hard on issues surrounding education and vows to keep at them, but admits heÕd like to see more progress.

ÒIÕm not satisfied with the progress,Ó Walsh said Thursday during his speech at the Boston Municipal Research BureauÕs annual meeting. ÒItÕs been strong in some areas, but too slow in others. So, weÕre going to keep working at it, and weÕre going to keep putting students first.Ó

Walsh discussed city plans to invest $1.14 billion into Boston Public Schools this year, the most ever from the city, which he says will help sustain progress toward universal prekindergarten programs, support at-risk high school students and expand engagement services.

Critics, however, have voiced concerns about the budget proposal and its allocations, specifically as it pertains to minority-led schools. As the Herald reported in February, education advocates told School Committee members at a previous meeting that the budget mostly addresses teacher raises and that kids were being left behind.

ÒYou are hurting the kids who are already disadvantaged,Ó said Robert Jenkins, a member of Generations Inc., a nonprofit focused on improving literacy skills for young children, who said his organization will no longer be able to work with students at Shaw Elementary under the new budget. ÒWhen it comes down to it, itÕs about our students, especially our students who donÕt get the same equity that other kids do.Ó

City Councilor At-Large Annissa Essaibi-George, who chairs the councilÕs committee on education, said at the time that the budget proposal has been Òunsettling to the community.Ó

ÒIt is like a punch in the gut and sort of like a game that schools and families have to play to get the budget to cover necessary things in the schools and it is demoralizing to do this year after year,Ó she said. Walsh said the city has a tall task in front of it and canÕt do it alone.

ÒI also want to be clear what weÕre asking our school communities to accomplish,Ó he said. ÒBoston serves more high-needs students than any other district in the state. Twice the rate of economic disadvantage. Three times the rate of English-language learners. É For our state to be serious about closing achievement gaps, those students must be at the heart of the conversation. Yet, if nothing changes, in two yearsÕ time, our state education aid will fall to zero.Ó",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Transportation,Curbside space for Uber and Lyft? ItÕs coming to Boston Ñ and is already in Somerville and Cambridge,TNC Charge,6.7,3/8/19,Adam Vaccaro,Boston Globe,10,5,5,"Uber and Lyft are flooding the streets of cities across the country Ñ including in Boston, where a ride started every single second in 2017, on average. The least they can do, officials figure, is not double-park when they pick up riders.

Boston is the latest city thatÕs planning to establish curb spaces for ride-hailing pickups and drop-offs, as transportation officials nationwide call for Òcurb managementÓ policies to cut down on drivers stopping in the middle of streets to start or end a ride.

In many ways, itÕs a modern take on an old idea; in a speech on Thursday, Mayor Martin J. Walsh described BostonÕs upcoming test of a dedicated ride-hailing space in the Fenway as Òsimilar to cab stands.Ó

Yet they are still relatively uncommon in big downtown or commercial areas, said Harry Campbell, an industry analyst who blogs about Uber and Lyft at TheRideshareGuy.com. ÒIÕve been kind of surprised, but also a little disappointed, because it would have a pretty positive impact for the riders, for the drivers, and for cities when it comes to congestion,Ó Campbell said.

ÒA lot of congestion is caused by people double-parking, or stopping where they shouldnÕt be. And picking up and dropping off passengers is the hardest part of the job.Ó

Washington has been among the leaders. The city has set up six pullover areas in popular precincts, said Jeffrey Marootian, director of D.C.Õs transportation department. While the designated spots have helped traffic flow, Marootian said that the cityÕs primary goal was improving safety.

ÒOne of the problems we sought to solve for was pedestrians and users of [ride-hailing] vehicles having to walk into travel lanes to access their vehicles,Ó he said.

Marootian said the loading zones have been a success, with small-business owners and elected officials calling for more of them across the city. But they differ from what BostonÕs planning in a key way, he said: They do not require riders to go to the dedicated area. In Boston, the companiesÕ apps will not allow riders who are near a pickup zone to request a ride from any other location Ñ marking a big change from the door-to-door service the companies have provided so far in Boston.

Southern California has a similar dedicated space in West Hollywood; elsewhere, as in Chicago, the ride companies may direct their riders to side streets off of busy thoroughfares. Uber and Lyft also often direct riders to specific pickup points near sports venues and convention centers.

Other cities have sought some form of compensation for the curbside access. At one point, San Francisco was planning to launch several pickup areas; in exchange, Uber would provide coveted ride data. That program apparently was never launched. And some transportation advocates have argued that Uber and Lyft should pay for access to the curb.

Chris Osgood, BostonÕs chief of streets, said the city is not asking for ride-hailing companies to pay for the space because the areas will also be available to the general public, such as when a husband drops off his wife.

The Fenway pickup zone will be the first established by the city government, though itÕs not an entirely new concept in Boston. On their own, Uber and Lyft already direct riders to designated pickup spots near South Station. And riders who request rides from Logan International Airport are redirected via the app to a designated parking lot. More pickup zones could emerge, depending on the success of the program in the Fenway.

Somerville and Cambridge have also established pickup zones Ñ in Assembly, Davis, and Union squares and along part of Massachusetts Avenue.

SomervilleÕs transportation director, Brad Rawson, said the pickup spots, which are also available to taxis and the general public, have helped cut down on double-parking in Davis Square. But, he warned, itÕs not a perfect system, because some drivers still let riders out before they reach the spot.

ÒIt is very challenging to enforce,Ó he said. ÒI would describe this as an important step in a larger evolution in how municipalities are managing curbside space.Ó

The transportation director Cambridge Joseph Barr, said the city may add similar zones in Harvard and Central squares in the future.

Uber and Lyft say they support the Boston project.

ÒThese zones will not only make moving around the area more convenient and frictionless, but it can meaningfully reduce congestion and improve the experience for drivers, riders, and the Greater Boston community,Ó said Lyft spokeswoman Campbell Matthews.

But the companies have been less keen about another Walsh administration proposal to cut down on ride-hailing traffic: It would drastically increase the 20-cents-per-ride fee levied on ride-hailing trips, especially on those taken by solo passengers. The idea is to encourage riders to share trips, with multiple passengers traversing a similar route being matched up Ñ leading to fewer cars on the road.

Instead, company officials have said they favor broader Òcongestion pricingÓ schemes that would charge all drivers who enter congested downtown areas, not just the ride-hailing drivers.

Changing the fees would require the Legislature to act. And Governor Charlie Baker said this week that increased ride-hailing fees are not Òon our radar at this point.Ó",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Walsh laid out Thursday to reduce carbon gas emissions.

ÒTo be clear: What will cost us the most is doing nothing,Ó Walsh told a crowd at the annual meeting of the Boston Municipal Research Bureau. ÒIf we donÕt act, carbon emissions will pose a threat to both public health and economic growth,Ó he said.

The mayorÕs annual speech to the bureau is typically one of his most high-profile of the year, and for 28 minutes he laid out a plan to address what he called three pressing policy issues: alleviating transportation congestion, increasing school funding, and addressing climate change caused by carbon gases.

It was also the last meeting for longtime Municipal Research Bureau president Samuel Tyler, who announced in January that he would retire after serving as a fiscal watchdog during four mayoral administrations. Walsh praised Tyler for his years of service. He also welcomed the incoming president, Pam Kocher, the first woman to lead the bureau in its nearly 90 years.

ÒThe people in this room . . . are the people who make up the city,Ó he said to the crowd, which included leaders from the business sector and charitable and civic organizations who represent the bureauÕs membership.

Looking to make an imprint in his second term in office, Walsh ticked off what he described as recent accomplishments to develop affordable housing and to raise funds to combat homelessness. A recently created City Academy to train residents for municipal jobs has graduated its first class, he said.

But the mayor also laid out policy areas where Òtrends are coming to a head and testing our capacity for collective action,Ó noting transportation, education, and climate change.

ÒTo put it simply, we canÕt grow our economy if we donÕt move people where they want to go; we canÕt share opportunity if we donÕt invest in the next generation; and we wonÕt have a future if weÕre underwater,Ó the mayor said, referring to rising sea levels caused by climate change.

His plans for charging stations for electric cars will require all new spaces in city parking garages to support electric vehicles, and all new private garages must have chargers in 25 percent of their spaces, with the rest wired for future use.

The mayor called on the Legislature to fix a school-funding formula for urban districts such as BostonÕs, which he said supports the stateÕs most at-risk students.

And the mayor proposed a series of fixes to the transportation system, from reducing the cityÕs speed limit to 20 miles per hour in neighborhoods to putting new burdens on ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft, which have contributed to congestion on city streets.

Some of the proposals would need state approval, but Walsh called for a regional partnership to address transportation and climate change, which he called Òthe defining challenge of our time.Ó

ÒWe need every level of government, every industry, and every individual in our region, to move forward with us,Ó the mayor said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Economic Mobility,Cap on Kids was a Failed Welfare Experiment,Cap on Kids,7.0,3/7/19,Editorial Board,Boston Globle,10,1,10,"A generation-long experiment that capped family welfare benefits, by penalizing those who gave birth while on public assistance, is at long last headed for the scrap heap of bad ideas in Massachusetts. The day canÕt come soon enough.

Repeal of the so-called Òcap on kidsÓ has been kicking around on Beacon Hill for several years. It almost made it through in the waning days of the 2018 legislative session. So this year lawmakers are taking no chances. There is, of course, a freestanding bill to repeal the cap. And with 104 sponsors in the House and 27 in the Senate, its passage seems assured. Governor Charlie Baker has included repeal and other welfare reforms in his 2020 budget proposal.

But newly named Senate Ways and Means Committee chairman Michael Rodrigues (D-Westport) sped up the process, adding the repeal measure to a must-pass $143.9 million mid-year spending bill.

The cap on kids was one of those mid-1990s Clinton-era welfare reforms aimed at addressing multigenerational poverty. In Massachusetts, it had its roots in the horrific scalding and neglect of 5-year-old Ernesto Ventura, in 1994, at the hands of his mother Claribel, a 26-year-old mother of seven. Within a year, the Legislature had passed, and Governor William Weld had signed, what was then called the Òtoughest in the nationÓ welfare reform bill. By the end of the decade, 21 states and the District of Columbia had adopted similar caps. But then the national legislative fever began to subside and the story of the Òwelfare momÓ having kids with the sole intent of collecting more in benefits indeed turned out to be more myth than reality.

A study by Rutgers University (New Jersey was among the first to pass a cap on welfare benefits) found Òvirtually identicalÓ birthrates among welfare mothers before and after the law passed, and both were Òconsistent with birthrates in the general population of New Jersey.Ó At least four states, including California, have already repealed their caps.

Massachusetts Law Reform Institute and Greater Boston Legal Services, which support repeal, maintain that the law currently deprives some 8,700 children of benefits. The remedy would cost the state about $13 million a year, which advocates say is readily affordable given the drop in overall numbers of welfare recipients. (Welfare benefits would go up about $100 a month to cover each currently uncovered child.)

The truly pernicious part is that the cap penalizes all siblings who then need to be fed and clothed with the same size benefit. ChildrenÕs Health Watch reported, ÒFrom 2010-2016, almost one-third of 1,358 caregivers receiving TAFDC [Temporary Aid to Families with Dependent Children] with children under the age of 4 interviewed at Boston Medical Center reported a child not supported on the familyÕs TAFDC budget because of the family cap rule.Ó The results were all too predictable Ð food insecurity and poor health outcomes.

Legislative trends come and they go. This one has clearly outlived whatever usefulness lawmakers thought it might have had more than two decades ago. ItÕs time to put caring for the stateÕs neediest children back on the priority list.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Transportation,"Walsh to propose 20 mph limit in neighborhoods and new Uber, Lyft pickup sites","TNC Charge, Regional Transport Ballot Initiatives, Photo Enforcement for Traffic Vioaltions",7.7,3/7/19,Milton Valencia,Boston Globle,10,5,8,"Mayor Martin J. Walsh plans to roll out a set of transportation initiatives Thursday, including proposals to lower speed limits in neighborhoods to 20 miles per hour and create designated pickup and drop-off sites in certain areas for ride-hailing services such as Uber and Lyft.

At his annual speech for the Boston Municipal Research Bureau, Walsh also is slated to announce that he has appointed a transit team to collaborate with the MBTA on issues such as quickening the bus system. And, heÕll say the city will offer free MBTA passes to all middle and high school students, regardless of the distance to their schools Ñ an increase from roughly 20,000 to more than 30,000 passes, at a cost of several million dollars.

The mayorÕs focus on transportation in one of his most high-profile speeches of the year demonstrates the importance of a spiraling transportation crisis that has left some streets and neighborhoods in virtual gridlock, amid frustrating delays in the regional public transit system.

ÒThese are things that are going to make a difference in peopleÕs lives,Ó said Chris Osgood, chief of city streets and transportation, in discussing the mayorÕs initiatives in advance of his speech. Walsh said in a prepared statement, ÒMaking sure our residents can get around our city in a safe and reliable way is key to ensuring BostonÕs opportunities extend to all.Ó

The speed limit plan follows a recent City Council proposal to limit the speed on neighborhood streets from 25 to 20 miles per hour, after the city had already reduced that number from 30 miles per hour two years ago. Osgood said the proposal would need state approval and the city must still work with city councilors and the state Legislature to identify where the speed limit should be lowered. The goal is to target neighborhood roads, not main throughways, he said.

ÒWe know that lower speeds save lives,Ó he said.

Last year, the city had 10 traffic fatalities, involving seven pedestrians and three bicyclists.

Amid concerns that Boston police have low rates of enforcing speed limits, Osgood said a lower speed limit will serve as a deterrent. He cited a Boston study by the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety that showed the city saw a 29 percent reduction in the number of cars traveling faster than 35 miles per hour after the speed limit was last lowered.

With funding from last yearÕs parking fine increase, the city has created a transit team to communicate with the MBTA, specifically on plans to speed up the regional bus transportation system. More than 350,000 passengers ride buses on every weekday, according to 2017 data, and buses remain the MBTAÕs least reliable form of transportation, Osgood said.

The plan would build off of a rapid bus transit pilot program in Roslindale, and would create a similar system Ñ with designated bus lanes Ñ on Brighton Avenue in Allston, and from the North Washington Bridge to the Haymarket bus system.

Osgood said those target routes Òare areas where we have a high number of bus drivers going at very slow speeds,Ó though the program could be eventually extended to other areas. He said the city will next target the Blue Hill Avenue corridor after hosting neighborhood meetings to discuss that route, which is longer and involves more business districts.

The city already offers MBTA passes to students in Grades 7 and 8 who live more than a mile and a half from their schools, and for high school students who live more than two miles away. As part of the transportation proposal, the city will extend those passes to all students, in public or charter schools Ñ an increase of 10,000 students. School officials said they must still negotiate fares with the MBTA, which subsidizes some of the costs, but the district currently funds $5.6 million for the passes.

WalshÕs plan also looks at the increase use of ride-hailing programs such as Uber and Lyft, which studies show has made traffic worse in Boston. Osgood said the city will focus on the effects of ride-hailing services such as double parking. In the next month or so, the administration will create its first designated curb space for ride-hailing pickups and drop-offs via a pilot program at Boylston and Kilmarnock streets in the Fenway neighborhood. Riders in a two-block vicinity of the dining and night life hub will be directed to the rendezvous spot in the companiesÕ apps Ñ much like the current designated pickup spots at the airport.

The spot will not yet be used for events letting out at Fenway Park, however.

ÒThis is one of the places [the companies] identified as being a challenge both for drivers and riders. It was also something we were hearing from local businesses there, so it made for an interesting place to try this,Ó said Kris Carter, who leads the MayorÕs Office of New Urban Mechanics.

The city is converting four parking spots to create the designated area, which will be active between 5 p.m. and 8 a.m. The cityÕs transportation department will install signs to guide riders and drivers to the spot, and, they said, it can be used by other drivers picking up or dropping off passengers Ñ not just ride-hailing trips.

The city will observe how it works in the Fenway before potentially expanding to other parts of Boston, Carter said.

Uber and Lyft representatives said they support the Boston project.

ÒThese zones will not only make moving around the area more convenient and frictionless, but it can meaningfully reduce congestion and improve the experience for drivers, riders, and the greater Boston community,Ó said Campbell Matthews, a Lyft spokeswoman.

Gina Fiandaca, the cityÕs transportation commissioner, said that the mayorÕs announcement builds on an action plan the city has slowly been implementing, though she said the city also needs help from the state.

The city has in recent months lobbied state lawmakers to allow Greater Boston communities to levy taxes to fund transportation projects; to assess higher fees for Uber and Lyft trips, especially for those with only one passenger; and to use cameras to enforce some driving violations, such as failure to stop for a school bus.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Housing,Mayor Walsh Leads 39th Annual Homeless Census,"Elderly Tenants, Linkage/IDP",6.7,2/7/19,,South Boston Today,1,10,9,"Mayor Martin J. Walsh recently led a group of hundreds of volunteers, including City and State officials, community and civic leaders, and homeless providers in conducting the CityÕs 39th annual homeless census. The street count is part of a larger census of homeless adults and families in emergency shelters, transitional housing, and domestic violence programs. The results from this yearÕs homeless census will be available in the coming months.   ÒWe have prioritized ending chronic homelessness since day one and making sure that everyone has a place to call home,Ó said Mayor Walsh. ÒBesides providing critical insight to guide our efforts to end homelessness while offering immediately assistance to individuals in need of shelter, the homeless census is always an opportunity to embrace who we are as a community, the values we share, and how deeply we care about one another.Ó   In 2017, Boston was identified by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) as the city with the lowest percentage of unsheltered people living on the street of any city conducting a census. Last year, less than three percent of BostonÕs homeless population was sleeping on the street. The annual homeless census is required by HUD as a key component of BostonÕs $26 million federal grant.   This year, 330 volunteers canvassed 45 areas covering every neighborhood, Logan Airport, and the transit and parks systems. Volunteers canvassed their assigned areas, identified those sleeping on the street, and conducted a short survey. The surveys will be closely analyzed to ensure accuracy and will be cross-checked and combined with the results of the simultaneous shelter count.   The night the 2018 Annual Homeless Census was conducted, 1,779 individuals were using BostonÕs Emergency Shelter system, compared to 1,762 in 2017. Boston also saw a decrease of more than 12 percent in the number of individuals sleeping on the street. In January 2018, there were 163 individuals sleeping on the street, as opposed to 186 in January 2017. Nationally, the number of unsheltered homeless has increased by 9 percent. There were no families staying on the streets or unsheltered in Boston on the night of the census.   BostonÕs Way Home, the CityÕs plan to end chronic and veteran homelessness prioritizes the housing first approach, meaning that when a person enters into the shelter system, they begin a path toward permanent and stable housing. Since the planÕs launch in 2015, City agencies and community partners have dramatically redesigned the way services are delivered to homeless individuals, increasing resources devoted to housing and deploying new technologies to match formerly homeless people with housing and services.   Since the launch BostonÕs Way Home, the City has: Housed 667 chronically homeless individuals, representing more than 4,000 years of homelessness ended. (The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services defines chronically homeless individuals as adults with a disability who have been either living in an emergency shelter or in a place not meant for human habitation continuously for 12 months or more, or who have had four occasions of homelessness in the past three years that total 12 months or more.) Reduced chronic homelessness in Boston by 20 percent from 2016 to 2018, and by 46 percent from 2008 to 2018 Housed 915 homeless veterans and ended chronic homelessness among veterans Reduced the number of homeless veterans in Boston on a single night by 37 percent since 2015 and by 48 percent over the past 4 years Partnered with six affordable housing owners in Boston to create a homeless veteran preference within their housing Announced an action plan to support young Bostonians experiencing homelessness Received $5 million in donations to build 200 new units of supportive, long-term housing for chronically homeless men in women through BostonÕs Way Home Fund   The City of Boston recently received a  $26.3 million federal grant to support BostonÕs homelessness programs. Boston was awarded the funding as the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced the results of its annual 2018 McKinney Homeless Continuum of Care funding competition. The award will be used to help end chronic and veteran homelessness in the City.   Mayor Walsh recently announced his legislative package submitted to the Massachusetts Legislature to create greater opportunity for all residents in the Commonwealth. The  bills related to housing security would prevent homelessness by helping existing tenants, particularly older adults, remain in their homes, and create additional funding for affordable housing. This work builds off BostonÕs commitment to ensuring all communities have affordable and equitable housing options.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Environment,Mayor Announces Actions to Acheive Carbon Neutrality in Boston,"Climate-Ready Commission, Gas Leaks Fine",7.3,1/31/19,City of Boston,Bay State Banner,2,10,10,"Mayor Martin Walsh Monday announced the City of BostonÕs next steps in updating BostonÕs Climate Action Plan to further strengthen the cityÕs ongoing initiatives to mitigate and adapt to climate change. The update includes a project beginning early next month to develop implementation roadmaps to significantly reduce BostonÕs carbon emissions. The roadmaps will identify critical action pathways for BostonÕs public and private building and transportation sectors, strengthening the strategies needed to achieve the CityÕs long-term goal of achieving carbon neutrality by 2050, a priority underscored through the newly released Carbon Free Boston report by the Boston Green Ribbon Commission.

The update to the CityÕs Climate Action Plan is set to be completed this year. The completion will signify BostonÕs full compliance with the Paris Agreement.

ÒAs we enter a new era of our CityÕs history, weÕre planning for storms, climate change, and the environmental threats the next generation will face,Ó Walsh said. ÒWe and our partners must be resilient and carbon neutral, from creating a Resilient Boston Harbor vision plan to moving forward with Community Choice Energy. IÕm grateful for the partnership of the Boston Green Ribbon Commission and the experts at Boston UniversityÕs Institute for Sustainable Energy. Their work will help us continue to lead, addressing the challenge of climate change.Ó

ÒMoving to carbon neutrality is an opportunity to advance BostonÕs status as a national climate leader and global hub of innovation while creating a cleaner, healthier, more equitable Boston for all,Ó said John Cleveland, executive director of the Boston Green Ribbon Commission. ÒThis analysis demonstrates that we can reach our goal by 2050, but only through a coordinated and concerted effort among the public and private sectors Ñ and we have to start now.Ó

According to the Carbon Free Boston report, Boston will achieve its climate goals if it pursues three strategies simultaneously: reduce demand for energy by increasing efficiency, convert most fossil fuel use to run on electricity, and buy 100 percent clean energy. The city will convene key partners and stakeholders to identify how Boston can continue to equitably act on these strategies over the next several years. The group will specifically look at accelerating the following actions:

Deep-energy retrofits and electrification programming, requirements, and incentives in BostonÕs existing buildings;
Zero Net Carbon construction in BostonÕs new buildings;
Electric vehicle adoption and installation of charging infrastructure, including for BostonÕs municipal fleet; and
Integrating Ònew mobilityÓ modes with BostonÕs legacy public transportation system including travel demand management.
 

Boston is one of the worldÕs leading cities committed to urgently pursuing high-ambition climate action, according to the C40 Climate Leadership Group.

ÒBoston is setting the global standard for bold climate action. The science of climate change is clear, and there is no time to waste in delivering on the necessary ambition of the Paris Climate Agreement,Ó said David Miller, North America Director, C40 Cities. ÒCities across America and around the world will be inspired by the leadership of Mayor Walsh, the Green Ribbon Commission and the people of Boston.Ó

As a leading city on climate action, Boston was recently named a winner of the Bloomberg American Cities Climate Challenge. The challenge will assist the city in strengthening and accelerating its progress toward reducing carbon pollution in BostonÕs building and transportation sectors. The city will receive a support package, valued at up to $2.5 million, and will apply that support to help advance the strategies in BostonÕs updated Climate Action Plan.

The two new climate-ready planning projects will deliver on strategies laid out in the mayorÕs Resilient Boston Harbor plan, which he announced at his annual Greater Boston Chamber of Commerce speech last year. It calls for investing in BostonÕs waterfront to protect against the impacts of rising sea level and climate change, and lays out strategies along BostonÕs 47-mile shoreline that will increase access and open space while better protecting the city during a major flooding event.

Last year, the Boston Planning & Development Agency adopted a Smart Utilities Policy that will ensure that new large developments are taking steps to create a more resilient city. The new policy, launched as a two-year pilot program, incorporates five Smart Utility Technologies into Article 80 Development Review, and BPDA Development Review Guidelines. The pilot calls for the adoption of technologies aimed at preparing BostonÕs utility infrastructure for the impacts of climate change, including increased flood risks, heat waves and stronger storms, reducing costs for end users, and reducing traffic congestion and roadway construction. The BPDA also has an E+ (Energy Positive) Green Building Program, which uses City-owned land to build high performance affordable housing.

In addition, the city currently requires that all new municipal buildings are built to a LEED Silver Standard, and that all new large buildings are built to a LEED-certifiable standard. The city is coordinating training for municipal building operators, through the Building Operator Certification program, to ensure buildings are running as efficiently as possible.

The Carbon Free Boston report underscores the importance of the 58 projects laid out in Go Boston 2030, the cityÕs plan to create a safer, more equitable, and low-carbon transportation future. The recently completed bus-only lane in Roslindale is the first of many more to come. The city has adjusted parking fines and is piloting performance pricing at parking meters to improve curbside parking. BostonÕs Transportation Department is installing safe bike lanes in strategic corridors to enable low-stress bike rides. The city has also issued Public Realm Guidelines to reclaim surplus roadway space as people-friendly gathering spaces. The Neighborhood Slow Streets Program is designing more inviting streets for walking and biking for all, furthering our progress towards BostonÕs Vision Zero goals. The Boston Transportation Department is hiring 20 new staff to implement active and public transportation projects in Go Boston 2030, to develop a roadmap for mass-scale electric vehicle adoption in Boston and to reduce demand for car travel through commuter incentives and innovative new mobility.

This work moves forward on the climate goals outlined in Imagine Boston 2030 and builds on WalshÕs recently announced legislative agenda. The legislative agenda, announced earlier this month, proposed two environmental bills that seek to create a statewide vehicle to work on climate resiliency projects and explore market incentives to reduce pollution caused by natural gas leaks. Soon, the city will receive recommendations from its advisory committee on how to move toward zero waste and will begin two new district-level planning projects in Downtown and Dorchester to create solutions to protect from coastal flooding due to sea level rise.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Housing,Councilors Seeks Solutions to City's Housing Dilemma,"Right to Counsel, Elderly Tenants, Linkage/IDP",4.0,1/30/19,Trea Lavrey,Bay State Banner,2,5,5,"One-fifth of all housing units in Boston are income-restricted, yet housing advocates and neighborhood residents regularly cite skyrocketing rents and displacement of long-term residents as their most pressing concerns.

While the administration of Mayor Martin Walsh is calling for the construction of 15,820 affordable units by 2030 Ñ 22 percent of the total of 69,000 units proposed in his Imagine Boston 2030 plan Ñ city councilors are seeking more drastic measures to curtail displacement. Earlier this month, city councilors Lydia Edwards and Kim Janey proposed a transfer tax that would discourage housing speculation and property-flipping and provide funding to build more affordable housing.

ÒWe need to make sure that Boston remains a city where people who currently live here and others who want to make Boston their home can continue to do so,Ó Janey said in a recent interview with the Banner.

ÒWhatÕs getting built is stuff that the average person canÕt afford to live in,Ó Edwards said. ÒThereÕs all this building going on, but people canÕt afford any of it.Ó

The two councilors believe that their proposed transfer fee, which would impose a 6 percent tax on real estate transactions above $2 million and a 25 percent tax on properties sold repeatedly within two years, is one solution, and would raise hundreds of millions of dollars.

Edwards and Janey arenÕt alone in their calls for more aggressive measures to stem the tide of displacement. In November, at-large Councilor Michael Flaherty surprised many when he suggested that city officials look again at rent control during a meeting on displacement in Roxbury.

ÒWe need to do something,Ó he later said in a November interview with the Boston Herald. ÒWhat weÕre doing now, itÕs just not putting a dent in the problem.Ó

That Flaherty, who in the past voted against rent stabilization measures, is calling for a look at rent control is perhaps the greatest indication of the increasing alarm with which city councilors are looking at displacement in their neighborhoods.

ÒCouncilor Flaherty clearly now sees the depth of the crisis and understands that production alone isnÕt the answer,Ó said Boston Tenant Coalition Executive Director Kathy Brown, who worked in the 1990s and 2000s on various rent control initiatives.

Creating affordable housing
Sheila Dillon, BostonÕs Chief of Housing and Director of Neighborhood Development, says that the city is doing its best to combat displacement.

ÒAffordable housing is created in two ways: with sites where one can build, and money to buy down rents and sales prices,Ó she said. ÒWeÕre also spending a lot of money preserving the affordable housing we have.Ó

There are three types of affordable housing in Boston: subsidized rentals, in which residents pay a set percentage of their income each month; income-restricted, which is limited to residents who earn a certain percentage of the area median income; and voucher programs, where residents are provided with a certain amount of money for rent each month and pay anything over that amount.

There are approximately 50,000 affordable housing units in Boston now, Dillon said, and the city works every year to create more, but building housing is expensive.

Earlier this month, Mayor Martin Walsh filed a housing legislation package that included both tenant protections, including rent control for senior residents, and provisions to raise housing revenue for the city, such as adjusting linkage fees.

ÒThe city needs housing for a range of incomes: for low-income seniors and low-income families to middle-income to workers that are coming into the city,Ó Dillon said.

Barriers in the real estate market
Karen Chen, a housing advocate and executive director of the Chinese Progressive Association, says that housing speculation has hurt long-term residents of Chinatown.

ÒOne of the biggest problems is buying and speculation of row houses,Ó Chen said. ÒThese historical buildings housed working families for generations, until housing speculation. With so many people trying to buy these row houses and add up the prices well above market, itÕs really putting a lot of working families at risk of facing imminent displacement.Ó

Chen also pointed out that because of ChinatownÕs central location in the city, many properties have been purchased for the sole purpose of renting them out for the short term on platforms such as Airbnb, displacing tenants.

Last year, the city passed an ordinance that regulates these short-term rentals. The ordinance, which went into effect on Jan. 1, imposes a fee on units that are rented out for periods of less than 28 days, and restricts what types of units can be used for short-term rentals.

ÒWeÕre pushing for the short-term rental ordinance in Boston because we know that things like that will spread to other neighborhoods,Ó Chen said.

Edwards also mentioned that for cheaper housing alternatives, such as cooperative housing, it is difficult for residents to obtain loans.

ÒThatÕs a really important thing, to look at different forms of ownership,Ó she said. ÒI donÕt know a bank thatÕs giving that kind of mortgage. ItÕs really bringing the financiers and helping educate that thereÕs different ways to finance.Ó

Housing initiatives
In addition to the transfer fee proposal from city councilors and legislation from the mayorÕs office, the city pours millions of dollars each year into creating affordable housing, but Edwards says it still isnÕt enough.

ÒThe city is making an effort, absolutely,Ó she said. ÒI just think that the greatest efforts, unless theyÕre fully funded and supported by a lot of money and capital, just wonÕt be able to make a big enough dent.Ó

Other ideas that have been floated in the past include a return to rent control, which Massachusetts residents narrowly voted out by ballot in 1994. (Voters in Boston, Cambridge and Brookline Ñ the sole three communities in the state that had rent control Ñ voted overwhelmingly to keep rent control that year).

Dillon says that the problem with aggressive measures like rent control is that, despite a majority of Boston residents being renters, it is difficult to get them passed. City councilors repeatedly blocked home rule petitions re-instating different forms of rent control during the past 20 years.

ÒIf weÕre going to expend energy on new legislation, we have to feel pretty confident that it has a likelihood of being passed, otherwise theyÕre statements,Ó Dillon said. ÒWhen we craft legislation, weÕre pushing to make things better, but we also have to be realistic. Making sure that our elders are safe and can stay in their homes Ñ that has a good likelihood of being passed.Ó

Edwards noted a current state bill filed by Senator Joseph Boncore, the HOMES Act, which would seal evictions after three years, much like similar laws in the state which seal misdemeanor crimes after three years and felonies after seven.

ÒIt would impact a million people in Massachusetts right now, and the majority of those people are women and people of color,Ó Edwards said. ÒThe question is how much of a punishment are you going to put on somebody, when 80 percent of evictions are due to non-payment of rent.Ó

Getting these measures passed is a question of money and of sheer will from their supporters, advocates say.

ÒItÕs important for resident renters and the cities to stand together, and really fight against this whole culture of land and housing speculation,Ó Chen said. ÒWe need to promote housing as a human right.Ó",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Economic Mobility,Mayor emphasizes economic development,"Fire Cadets, PROMISE Act",7.0,1/24/19,Trea Lavrey,Bay State Banner,2,10,9,"In his annual State of the City address last week, Boston Mayor Martin Walsh announced the opening of a mobile Economic Development Center that will offer free workshops to community members on equity and inclusion, small business, community economic development, and jobs and talent.

ÒNow, we not only require funds for job training; it must be training that helps local residents fill those new jobs,Ó Walsh said in his speech. ÒWeÕll be in every neighborhood, with job training and business workshops, like how to open a restaurant or compete for a city contract.Ó

The Economic Development Center will hold workshops throughout the year at accessible locations in every neighborhood of the city, and will also offer interpretation services and a child-friendly environment for attendees who are parents.

Chief of Economic Development John F. Barros said, ÒTo ensure our economic development strategies deliver real results for Bostonians, we are bringing policy and resources to residents and businesses in an accessible, thoughtful and collaborative manner.Ó

The Office of Economic Development will also work with residents to get their feedback on policy and work with businesses and individuals to access local resources, trainings and other opportunities.

The workshop series is part of WalshÕs Boston Hires campaign, launched in 2018, to get 20,000 residents into jobs with a living wage by 2022.

Walsh cited the cityÕs current unemployment rate of 2.4 percent, the lowest ever recorded.

In 2017, the administration launched the Small Business Center, a pilot version of the new Economic Development Center. It offered workshops in Mattapan, East Boston and Roxbury. While the plan was originally to create a physical center to hold workshops, Walsh said in a statement that the Small Business Center was so successful that it was simply expanded to include the entire city.

Walsh also stressed in his State of the City address his continued determination for Ògrowing our middle class,Ó a promise he made in his 2018 inauguration speech.

Also in the Tuesday night address, Walsh discussed the cityÕs efforts towards diversity, highlighting the proposal for a Fire Cadet program, following a city report released Jan. 9 exposing an unwelcoming culture toward female firefighters.

ÒWe are changing BostonÕs culture for the better,Ó Walsh said. ÒOur City Council is the most diverse itÕs ever been, in background and in experience. Council members are attorneys, teachers, housing advocates, small business owners and veterans.Ó

Other topics in the State of the City address included the cityÕs dedication to combating climate change, lowering crime rates, funding libraries, arts and culture, investments in renewing Boston Common and Franklin Park, funding education, fighting addiction and the creation of the Age Strong Commission, formerly the Elderly Commission, to better serve seniors in the city.

Walsh closed his speech by criticizing federal lawmakers in Washington, D.C. and announcing that he and Governor Charlie Baker will soon be visiting the nationÕs capital to advocate for investments in housing, transportation and the environment.

ÒInstead of building a wall, letÕs show them how to build bridges,Ó Walsh said. ÒTo our national leaders, I say: If you want to learn how to bring people together, not push them apart, look to Boston.Ó",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Housing, Economic Mobility",Walsh introduces housing and economic mobility bills to legislature,"Linkage/IDP, CPA, Right to Counsel, Elderly Tenants, Community College, Liquor Licenses,",6.3,1/18/19,,Spare Change News,1,10,8,"Mayor Martin J. Walsh announced his comprehensive housing security and economic mobility legislative package on Jan. 7. The 14 bills are the first of four legislative packages that the City of Boston will be submitting to the Massachusetts Legislature.

The six housing bills concern programs and issues such as the Linkage Program, the Community Preservation Act, inclusionary development and tenantsÕ rights.

One act, a home rule petition, would allow the City of Boston to change its Linkage Program, which helps build affordable housing in Boston, on an annual basis, as opposed to the state-required three years. Since 2014, according to the Boston Planning and Development Agency, $31.4 million in housing linkages have contributed to 39 developments, creating 1,268 affordable units, preserving 548 existing affordable units and helping 2,300 low and moderate income residents access job training.  

Another act seeks to increase funding for the Community Preservation Act (CPA), which would increase the fees for recording deeds to return the state match to closer to 50 percent, as the match was just 19 percent when Boston joined the coalition of cities and towns that receive CPA funds.

The CPA requires at least one percent  of residential and business property tax bills to go into the Community Preservation Fund (CPF), which 170 cities and towns draw from to fund affordable housing, open space and historic preservation. In June of 2018, Walsh recommended 35 projects requiring less than $500,000 to begin construction with CPF funds in the fall of 2018.

The mayor also included an act that provides low-income tenants facing eviction with a court-appointed attorney for representation, and creates a public task force Òto create an implementation plan.Ó

Another act would prohibit no-fault eviction of tenants aged 75 and older in properties with six or more rental units. Eviction would be permitted only in cases where tenants fail to pay rent, damage the property or use of the premises for illegal activities. In addition, the  act would limit rent increase for tenants aged 75 and older to five percent per year, to prevent landlords from using large rent increases to create justification to permit eviction.

Also being presented to the legislature is an act that would ÒmemorializeÓ BostonÕs Inclusionary Development Program (IDP) into the Zoning Code.

The IDP requires property developers to set aside income restricted affordable housing units when they propose residential projects of ten units or more, if they are financed by the City of Boston or Boston Planning and Development Agency (BPDA) or built on their property. Property developers have the choice to include the affordable unit on-site, off-site, or make an equivalent cash contribution towards the creation of a unit. This proposal would require all residential projects of 10 or more units to follow IDP obligations, regardless of petitions for zoning relief.

Some residents believe that the government should do a better job monitoring compliance. According to a DigBoston article, in 2017, developer Leah Popielarski of Cohasset sold two condo units (135 Athens Street / 160 West Broadway) designated for affordable housing, at market prices by purchasing them through Seaport Residential, a company she had formed. Likewise, developers will have incentives not to comply, if they are still able to gain a profit even after paying penalties. In PopielarskiÕs case even with the $600,000 BPDA fine, she was still left with $732,000 by selling the two IDP required units for $664,000 each.

The final local option bill would provide tenant associations of residential rental properties with more than five rental units with the right of first refusal to collectively purchase properties at fair market value, the right to purchase to a non-profit acting on their behalf, and the right to match any bona fide offer to sell property.

Property owners have strongly opposed giving tenants the right to first refusal. A bill in Washington DC ran into trouble, and a similar bill was struck down in Cambridge. When Cambridge City Council rejected City Councillor Dennis J. CarloneÕs proposal, Hasson J. Rashid, a low income tenant advocate, wrote a letter in response, noting it was Òa shameÉ to trashing rights of the most vulnerable segments of the populationÓ

Included in the eight economic mobility bills is a bill to replicate BostonÕs Tuition-Free Community College (TFCC) Initiative and implement it statewide. Launched in June 2016, TFCC serves 295 students at Bunker Hill Community College, Roxbury Community College and MassBay Community College. According to the WalshÕs office, students in the program have a graduation rate of 70 percent over three years.

Another home rule petition would expand the number of liquor licenses in Boston, targeting neighborhoods that were historically disadvantaged by the liquor license process and would benefit from restaurants, which the mayorÕs office refers to as the Òlifeblood of neighborhood business districts.Ó  

In 2017, a government task force, convened by State Treasurer Deborah Goldberg and made up of seven lawyers and state officials with no connections to the alcohol business, recommended relaxing limits on the number of alcohol licenses grocery store chains can hold and other rules such as allowing pubs to sell beer through other retailers. Many of these rules are remnants of the Prohibition era, preventing restaurant owners from establishing businesses as permits could cost up to 450,000$.

In addition to expanding licenses, the Boston Globe reports that reform is needed to fund the Alcohol Beverages Control Commission (ABCC). The commission is understaffed with just 15 investigators Ð one for every 800 alcohol retailer Ð and underfunded.

There are also two bills concerning workersÕ rights in the package. The first would require state contracting officers to consider an employerÕs record of workplace law compliance, including health and safety standards, wage laws and civil rights laws, before awarding the employer a contract. The goal is to protect workers from wage abuse, workplace discrimination, and unsafe working conditions.

The other act would mandate all companies with more than 100 employees to report the gender and race of employees holding specific management titles, and require the Office of Labor and Workforce Development to post the data. It would also establish a fund to provide professional development services to employees who observe a disparity between the total number and their employerÕs total, in order to help improve their employerÕs ratio.

Also in this legislative package is an act that would remove the cap on assets for families receiving temporary cash assistance. The current policy discourages families from saving money, and makes it more difficult for them to access resources. Eight other states have enacted similar changes.

Another act would repeal a policy that denies critical resources to children conceived while, or soon after, a family is receiving benefits. Massachusetts is one of only 17 states that have a Òcap on kidsÓ or similar policy.

Walsh is also pushing for legislation to increase  the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) to 50 percent, and return money directly to more than 400,000 eligible low-and moderate-income individuals and families. In 2015, Governor Charlie Baker successfully passed a similar act, which increased the EITC from 15 percent to 23 percent, an equivalent of $500 additional support for each eligible individual.   

There was also a bill to explore ways  to raise for sustained investment in the tourism and arts and culture sector.

Joe Kreisberg, President and CEO of the Massachusetts Association of Community Development Corporations, noted in an interview with the mayorÕs office that ÒweÕre very pleased with the interlocking package of Housing Security bills that Mayor Walsh is submitting to the legislature. Strengthening tools like the Inclusionary Development Program and Linkage to ensure that Boston will be able to build income-restricted housing in the future represents great forward-thinking. WeÕd like to see more cities and towns utilize these tools to build more affordable housing in their communities, and to adopt the needed tenant protections the package offers to the CommonwealthÕs most vulnerable households.Ó

Public responses, such as facebook comments on Boston publications like the Globe and Herald, have been mixed between warm support and criticism. The main question remains, whether the State Legislature will approve these proposed bills. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The Democratic mayor will deliver his fifth State of the City address 6 p.m. at Symphony Hall. 

""What you want to do, for me anyway, in those speeches is you want to be able to inform the Boston resident of what we're doing, inform the Boston resident of where we're going and lay out a little bit of a plan,"" Walsh told reporters Thursday.  

Last week, the mayor announced his legislative priorities for his sixth year in office, including a focus on health care, education, housing, transportation, the environment, and public safety. Walsh said he plans to discuss some of these bills broadly during the address Tuesday night. 

""I want to be creative and try to do something different,"" Walsh told reporters. ""You know, people you don't want the same old, same old. People want to see different stuff.""

Here are eight bills the mayor plans to promote on Beacon Hill in 2019 that we can expect he'll discuss in his Tuesday night address. 

1. An Act to Protect Elderly Tenants
This would ban no-fault evictions of people ages 75 and older. This means evictions would only be permitted when the resident has done something wrong like failed to pay rent, damaged the property, or used the space for illegal activities. 

Landlords that own properties with six or more rental units would be required to provide notice to the local community at the same time a eviction notice is served to an elderly tenant. 2. An Act to Increase Access to Affordable Community College
This bill would replicate Boston's Tuition-Free Community College initiative launched in June 2016 across the state. Currently, 295 students attend Bunker Hill Community College, Roxbury Community College, and MassBay Community College through the program, according to the mayor's office. 3. An Act to Create Economic Vitality in Boston Neighborhoods
This would increase the number of liquor licenses available in Boston and target them to neighborhoods that would benefit from ""an influx of restaurants to drive economic activity,"" according to the mayor's office. 

""Restaurants are the lifeblood of neighborhood business districts, providing jobs and gathering spaces, and spurring other businesses to locate nearby, and this balanced approach to licensing ensures neighborhoods historically disadvantaged by the liquor license process will receive their fair share,"" the mayor's office wrote in a statement. 4. An Act to Establish a Commission for a Climate Ready Commonwealth
This bill would develop a regional commission aimed at figuring out which group should lead major coastal and resiliency projects. The commission would also identify how these projects should be funded and prioritized. 

""Boston is not alone in facing the threat of climate change, and all communities are experiencing the reality of extreme heat, snow, rain, and flooding. As the impacts increase and intensify, it's more important now than ever before to coordinate investments to adapt infrastructure and our natural and built environment to future climate conditions,"" the mayor's office said in a statement. 5. An Act to Modernize our Natural Gas Infrastructure
Following the natural gas disaster in the Merrimack Valley, safety has been on the forefront of many Boston officials' minds. Walsh is no different. 

The bill would impose a fine on natural gas providers for the ""total volume of all gas leaks,"" according to the mayor's office. This would incentivize utility companies to update infrastructure, according to the mayor's office. 6. An Act to Better Prepare the Commonwealth for Climate and Disaster Refugees
The commission established through this bill would study Massachusetts' response to the displacement of people from Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. It would aim to improve the commonwealth's response protocols for connecting evacuees with social services and housing. 

The commission would also look into establishing a state fund or trust for supplement aid to future evacuees. 

7. An Act Relative to Diversion to Substance Abuse Treatment for Non-Violent Drug Offenders
Through this bill, the state would allow people facing first and second non-violent drug offenses an opportunity to be evaluated by a licensed addiction specialist. The specialist would determine if the person is dependant on drugs and whether they would benefit from treatment. 

If the person is deemed to be addicted to drugs, he or she would be offered an assignment to a drug treatment facility. Court proceedings would be halted until completion of the treatment program.  8. An Act to Prevent Gun Violence
This bill would require medical professionals to ask patients about guns in their home. This would, ideally, help doctors, nurses, and other medical professionals identify red flags that could indicated risks of suicide, domestic violence and a child's access to guns. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All,Walsh's State House Agenda Gives Glimpse Of State Of The City Speech,"Right to Counsel, Elderly Tenants, Gas Leaks Fine, TNC Charge",8.7,1/13/19,Mike Deehan,WGBH,8,10,8,"Boston Mayor Marty Walsh will give his sixth major annual speech Tuesday evening at Symphony Hall, a showcase for the second term accomplishments his administration wishes to tout, as well as a look into Walsh's future plans for Boston and Massachusetts as a whole.

""I think what you want to do, for me anyway, in those speeches is you want to be able to inform the Boston resident of what we're doing, inform the Boston resident of where we're going and kind of lay out a little bit of a plan,"" Walsh said of the upcoming State of the city address.

""This is now my sixth either swearing-in or State of the City. So it's tricky. And you want to be creative and try and do something different,"" Walsh told reporters Thursday after the annual Three Kings Day celebration at City Hall.

One of the different tones Walsh has taken in the buildup to his speech is the roll-out of an ambitious legislative agenda aimed at getting Boston's, and Walsh's, priorities passed into law on Beacon Hill. The mayor is puissant in the corridors of City Hall, but in the State House, where he served as a representative from Dorchester for 16 years, his power is more persuasive than compulsory.

On Walsh's mind for what state lawmakers should get behind are bills on public safety, energy and environment, education, economic mobility, transportation and health.

""It's not the answer completely to these questions, but what it does, it allows us the tools to be able to address the issues around housing, climate, resiliency, education, safety Ñ things like that,"" Walsh said of his 30-bill agenda released throughout last week. Each topic area was accompanied by a roundtable briefing with some of the city's top officials, including Boston Police Commissioner William Gross.

Walsh wants lawmakers to pass bills granting some low-income tenants the right to counsel in eviction proceedings, rent relief for the elderly, giving the city the ability to fine gas companies for untended leaks and redirecting more tax money from ride-hailing apps to city coffers.

""We're looking at some of the ridesharing issues and making sure that we can create more opportunities for revenue to go into climate resiliency and also reduce traffic,"" Walsh said.

Walsh said the areas he's heard the most from Bostonians, and where he's targeted his legislation, is on housing, traffic and congestion issues, energy use and climate adaptation.

Walsh's legislative successes in his first five years in office are hard to pin down, suggesting that his blessing on this year's slate may not be as effective as advocates would like to believe. Many of the bills he declared support for in previous sessions met untimely deaths in legislative committees, but there may have been less tangible successes in the secretive budget arena and in behind-the-scenes talks with his former colleagues that have benefitted Boston.

When repeatedly asked for examples of the mayor's past legislative victories over the last five years, Walsh's administration did not respond. Aside from a major education funding bill filed by Sen. Sonia Chang-Diaz, no legislative sponsors for Walsh's bills were known by Sunday. The bill filing deadline for legislation is Friday.

City Councilor Matt O'Malley said he's pleased with Walsh's agenda roll-out, especially the gas leaks provisions he's been fighting for on the council level.

""He's in his second term, has an opportunity maybe to be a little bolder on certain issues, so I was very pleased with sort of the the aggressive nature of many of the bills,"" O'Malley said.

Walsh said he's ""been pretty aggressive when it comes to new Legislative sessions,"" and that this year in particular, his office is doing more outreach on items he backs, like Chang-Diaz's bill to rewrite the local school funding formula.

""You know, if we don't get some major funding formula changes in two years, Boston will be paying the state to educate kids, and that's not something that will be sustainable long term here in the city of Boston,"" Walsh said.

Chang-Diaz has championed the bill for years and sees an opportunity this year to get it past the finish line. Walsh was one of the main speakers at a State House press conference touting the education funding bill last week.

""It is not the sole responsibility of any mayor to do all, to carry all the advocacy load for their community. That's why you have a legislative delegation as well. So, you know, it's our job to work together to be good partners,"" Chang-Diaz said, adding that Walsh, like most municipal leaders, informs the city's delegation from his perspective as city CEO.

Another element of Walsh's legislative push is the deep ties he has in the State House, especially in the more moderate House under Speaker Robert DeLeo. Walsh served as DeLeo's Ethics Committee Chair until his election as mayor in 2013.

Former Boston CIty Councilor Larry DiCara has watched several mayors haggle with Beacon Hill over legislation. He said Walsh is unique in recent memory because of the ""extraordinary, long-standing personal relationships"" both he and top City Hall attorney Eugene O'Flaherty, also a former DeLeo lieutenant, enjoy with top legislative leaders.

""He was in the legislature a long time,"" DiCara said. ""And there are members of the legislature who are more likely to vote for a bill which he has sponsored than a bill being sponsored by somebody whose mayor was not in the Legislature.""

As for the speculation that Walsh's ambitious agenda, with several bills spilling out from the city limits to effect the rest of the Commonwealth, signals a turn to statewide interests, O'Malley isn't convinced.

""What's good for Boston is good for the state. What's good for the state is good for Boston. So I don't think there's any tea leaves that can be read with this,"" O'Malley said of Walsh's possible political ambitions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All,"Walsh in bid to boost cityÕs role in tenant protection, linkage fees, liquor permits",Liquor Licenses,7.3,1/10/19,Jennifer Smith,Dot Reporter,3,10,9,"Increasing the number of liquor licenses, upping fees derived from commercial developments, and moving toward better tenant protections are among the priorities that Mayor Martin Walsh laid out in the 14-bill legislative package he announced on Monday.

The collection of bills, focused on Òeconomic mobility and housing security,Ó is the first of four that the administration plans to send up to the State House during this legislative session.

Several of the bills seek greater flexibility for BostonÕs control of its economic assets, like the pricey and increasingly scarce land in the city and the still-nascent full-service restaurant businesses in underserved neighborhoods.

Two home rule petitions put before the city council on MondayÑ a first step before they can go to the Legislature Ñ address liquor licenses and an increase in linkage fees.

ÒFrom the last time we did this, we learned that some of our neighborhoods are not as ready as other neighborhoods to take advantage of the opportunity to increase full-service restaurants on their main streets,Ó said John Barros, the cityÕs economic development chief. ÒAnd we had certain neighborhoods that we were frankly targeting did not even apply.Ó Mattapan, for instance, had zero applications for the neighborhood-restricted licenses.

Boston has 1,188 active liquor licenses, 812 of them all-alcohol, and 376 in the beer and wine category. The administrationÕs ÒAct to Create Economic Vitality in Boston NeighborhoodsÓ asks for an increase in the number of reduced-cost licenses targeted at specific neighborhoods in need of an economic boost that can come from a robust restaurant scene.

Among the dozens of new licenses that could come from the bill would be bundles of three all-alcohol and two wine and beer licenses that could be specifically designated for certain neighborhoods, including Dorchester, Mattapan, Roxbury, and Hyde Park. If an area does not have an active application, the licenses would remain allotted to the designated neighborhood until the demand rises, rather than being left to be picked off by other neighborhoods.

ÒFor instance, Mattapan would be allotted five licenses a year for three years, and if no one applied for those liquor licenses, they will remain on the shelf,Ó Barros told reporters during a briefing at City Hall last Friday. ÒAnd as we worked with entrepreneurs and businesses in Mattapan and other neighborhoods, the liquor licenses would be there so when you build capacity and you have business that are ready to apply, they could then apply.Ó

In cases like DorchesterÕs South Bay Town Center, prospective home to multiple restaurants, the city is planning to create pricier and restricted umbrella licenses for developments with a combined 700,000 square feet or more and at least 125,000 square feet of commercial/retail space. This would stop the businesses from applying for neighborhood or city-wide licenses in bulk and taking them away from individual local restaurants.

The other bill before the council would allow Boston to adjust its linkage formula for developments annually instead of once every three years. New 100,000-square-foot-plus commercial developments that need zoning relief require fees of $9.03 per square foot.

ÒThis would, very basically, allow the city to make its own adjustments,Ó rather than being tied to state standards, city housing chief Sheila Dillon said.

BostonÕs Inclusionary Development Policy (IDP), which sets requirements for affordable housing production, would be Òsafeguarded,Ó Dillon said, in another bill. They will later reassess the actual standards of the policy, but for now the administration is focused on applying it more broadly.

This bill would also entrench the IDP in the zoning codes to allow the city to secure affordable housing obligations from residential projects even if they technically fall under Òas of rightÓ designations.

ÒAs the [Boston Planning and Development Agency] does more planning in the city and more and more residential developments become as-of-right, we are worried that IDP Ñ well, not worried, because it wonÕt Ñ would not apply to those projects,Ó Dillon said. ÒSo, this change would require all developments over 10 units to comply with the IDP requirements.Ó

Tom Callahan, executive director of the Massachusetts Affordable Housing Alliance (MAHA), praised the proposed bills this week. ÒItÕs a strong package,Ó he said. ÒItÕs well-balanced between revenue and tenant protections, Ôexpand the pieÕ-type legislation.Ó

Some future sources of funding could also come from regulating short-term rentals like Airbnb, Callahan said, where new state legislation now allows municipalities to set a special impact fee for such rentals. The Òreal workÓ he said, is figuring out what home rule petition comes out of the city council, which is already considering a linkage bill. And tenant protections are taking a more piece-by-piece track after the defeat in the State House last year of the Jim Brooks Act, a home-rule effort meant to allow the city to monitor ongoing eviction proceedings and to alert the tenants facing removal of their rights.

ÒHousing and economic mobility are linked: a stable home allows residents to pursue opportunities,Ó Walsh said in a statement. ÒIn Boston, weÕve increased our affordable housing goals and worked to ensure that everyone has a home in our city. We are doubling down on economic mobility by supporting small businesses, many of them owned by women, immigrants, and people of color, reforming parts of the system that create barriers that keep people in poverty, and providing new pathways to good jobs.Ó

The mayorÕs office says the housing security bills build on the work the city is already doing, and would provide some new tools. A bill would allow tenant organizations in a building with five or more units the right to either buy the building for fair market value or assign the purchasing right to a non-profit on their behalf.

Another would ensure a right to legal counsel for low-income households facing eviction. A third would add in protections for elderly tenants, including and prohibiting no-fault eviction for those over 75 years old and limiting rent increases to five percent annually.

ÒWeÕre seeing many elders lose their homes, the homes they have been able to enjoy for decades, so we feel very strongly that this is a very, very vulnerable population that needs to be protected,Ó Dillon said.

Callahan added that tenant protections are a vital step forward in ensuring housing stability. ÒThe senior protection bill is innovative and important,Ó he said, Òand I know itÕs going to get severe criticism from a portion of the landlord lobby, but it feels like thatÕs a bold move to try to say, ÔWe understand those types of protections are necessary.ÕÓ

Although the Community Preservation Act passed in 2016 has been a boon, raising millions through a one percent property tax surcharge, officials said state matching funds declined after Boston joined the roughly 170 other cities and towns who had signed on to a version of the CPA.

The 19 percent, Dillon said, is Ònot a good enough match from the state.Ó She added, ÒWe would certainly like to get the match up closer to 50 percent.Ó

Another of the proposed bills would increase the surcharge on fees for recording deeds to boost the funds available for a state match. That bill, to be filed by the Community Preservation Coalition with WalshÕs support, is one of several with a statewide bent that the mayor hopes will be considered this session.

Others include legislation to expand BostonÔs tuition-free community college program; expand the Earned Income Tax Credit to 50 percent, which city officials say would return more than $420 million to state households; and a proposal to establish a statewide Commission on Tourism and Arts and Culture Investment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

ÒWe are doubling down on economic mobility by supporting small businesses, many of them owned by women, immigrants and people of color, reforming parts of the system that create barriers that keep people in poverty, and providing new pathways to good jobs.Ó

The bills will be submitted to the state legislature by Jan. 18, the deadline for filing.

Housing bills
The legislation package Walsh administration officials made public Monday contained six bills related to housing security, with the intention of supporting the growth of affordable housing and tenant protections.

Currently, one in five housing units in the city is restricted to tenants with no income to moderate incomes.

ÒUntil we have enough affordable housing for everyone, we have to make sure residents are protected,Ó said Sheila Dillon, chief of housing and director of neighborhood development, speaking during a press briefing last week.

The first bill, which was submitted on Monday, would allow the city to adjust ÒlinkageÓ fees developers must pay on commercial developments of more than 100,000 square feet that require zoning relief. The funds derived from these fees are disbursed by the Neighborhood Housing and Neighborhood Jobs trusts to support affordable housing and job training programs. The change would allow the city to adjust the amount developers must pay as needed, instead of every three years, as the current law stands.

The package also includes a bill that would provide low-income tenants with court-appointed attorneys in eviction proceedings, as well as form a task force to create an implementation plan for this law. The bill is supported by tenant advocacy groups and organizations such as the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute.

ÒItÕs more costly to deal with a poor family after they have lost their home,Ó Dillon said, citing healthcare, housing and employment as reasons why the mayorÕs office is working hard on this bill.

Another bill would give incorporated tenant associations the right to collectively purchase their residential rental properties at a fair market value before the properties are put on the market, protecting tenants from losing their homes under new landlords.

ÒSome of the largest displacements occur when buildings change hands,Ó Dillon said.

Other bills include an act to prohibit no-fault eviction of tenants 75 years and older, an act that would increase Community Preservation Act funding and an act that would write BostonÕs Inclusionary Development Policy, which promotes the production of affordable housing, into the cityÕs zoning code. The tenant protections for those 75 and older includes a cap on rent increases of 5 percent a year.

Economic bills
The second set of eight bills in the first legislative package focus on economic equity and mobility. These bills would make it easier for less-advantaged citizens to take advantage of economic opportunities in the city.

The first bill would replicate BostonÕs Tuition-Free Community College program statewide. The program, which currently serves 295 students at Bunker Hill, Roxbury and MassBay Community Colleges, provides the Òlast dollarÓ in funding for tuition and fees at these colleges for students who have received Pell grants.

Another bill would lift the cap on assets for families receiving temporary cash assistance, allowing poor families to save money without losing benefits. Eight other states have eliminated this cap and have seen positive results.

ÒWe know that an incentive to save for college and other savings is important for empowerment,Ó said Trinh Nguyen, director of the MayorÕs Office of Workforce Development.

The package also contains an act that would raise the number of liquor licenses available, and prioritize them to areas that would benefit economically from more restaurants.

Chief of Economic Development John Barros explained that this has been done before, though with less-than-satisfactory results.

ÒWe learned that some neighborhoods are not as ready as others to increase full-service restaurants on their streets,Ó Barros said, naming Mattapan as one area where the available extra liquor licenses went unused.

He explained that the difference this time would be a lower price for the licenses to mitigate risk and that the licenses would not go away if not used. The city will also introduce a new ÒumbrellaÓ-type license for larger developments that may have multiple restaurants, such as DorchesterÕs South Bay Center, to protect smaller business ventures from losing out on the available licenses.

Other bills in the legislative package would raise the state Earned Income Tax Credit to 50 percent, returning money directly to low- and moderate-income families; require state contractors to consider an employerÕs record of workplace law compliance; require companies with more than 100 employees to report gender and race information for employees in management and provide professional development services to improve ratings at companies where there are disparities; repeal the ÒCap on KidsÓ policy that denies resources to children conceived while, or soon after, a family is receiving benefits; and create a statewide commission on tourism investment.

Walsh is expected to release more legislative packages, containing bills related to education, the environment, transportation and other areas, starting later this week.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Education,Beacon Hill looks to tackle school funding formula in new session,PROMISE Act,6.7,1/10/19,Victoria McGrane,Boston Globe,10,5,5,"
The year on Beacon Hill is starting with renewed momentum to overhaul the stateÕs troubled, 26-year-old school funding formula, which critics say now perpetuates inequality in education by short-changing some communities and favoring others.

After efforts to rewrite the formula collapsed at the end of the LegislatureÕs formal session last July, Governor Charlie Baker kicked off his second term last week vowing that Massachusetts Òcan and must do betterÓ to bridge the gap between urban and suburban school performance.

He said he plans to file a bill to rewrite the funding formula Ñ a signal that he is interested in going further than the changes he has proposed in the past. House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo has voiced support for tackling the issue. Senate President Karen E. Spilka says itÕs a top priority for her chamber.

Seeking to accelerate Beacon HillÕs often glacial pace, Senator Sonia Chang-Diaz on Wednesday rolled out a revamped version of the SenateÕs funding bill from last session alongside four dozen legislators, mayors, and other advocates gathered behind the podium. ÒThere are no more excuses. . . . There are no more wait till next years. It is time to keep our promise,Ó said Chang-Diaz, referring to the pledge she says the 1993 education overhaul law made to fund an adequate education for every student. State Representative Alice Peisch, a Wellesley Democrat who cochairs the Joint Education Committee, said in a statement to the Globe that the House Òremains committed to implementing a plan this yearÓ to carry out recommendations issued in 2015 by a legislative commission tasked with reviewing the foundation budget for the stateÕs school funding system. That commission found the formula had been underestimating the cost of schooling by hundreds of millions of dollars and set out several recommendations to fix it.

Noting he had convened a group of members of that commission in August, DeLeo said Wednesday that the House Òwill continue to prioritize its commitment to funding and supporting our schools.Ó

The broad consensus that an overhaul is needed has many players in the debate encouraged Ñ albeit cautiously, in some cases Ñ that lawmakers may just be able to carry legislation over the finish line this time around.

ÒIt is a good sign that all three branches on Beacon Hill now seemed to have raised this to a high level of priority,Ó said Paul Reville, an education secretary under then-governor Deval Patrick who has been following the debate closely.

Critics say the state formula for doling out aid has failed, by a wide margin, to keep pace with the actual cost of providing a public education. Real estate taxes fund most of the rest of school spending, a fact that further locks in inequality of opportunity, because poorer municipalities simply have lower property values.

The result, as the Globe reported last year, is that places like Worcester and Brockton struggle. Brockton spent just $1.28 per student on classroom supplies during the 2016-17 school year, while Weston, one of the wealthiest towns, provided $275 per student.

Teachers unions and others say fixing the funding situation would make good on the bargain struck in 1993. ÒWe are underfunding education on the backs of our most vulnerable children, betting on which of them will figure out how to survive,Ó said Tanisha M. Sullivan, president of the Boston branch of the NAACP. ÒWeÕre standing at a moral crossroad. If we truly value our children and education, we must come together to deliver on the promise.Ó

Other advocates say struggling schools need more than just an influx of cash. Groups including the Massachusetts Business Alliance for Education, a business-backed advocacy organization, and Massachusetts Parents United, representing urban district parents, say they want some of the money used to encourage new approaches to boost student performance.

Saying that Òprogress isnÕt just about money,Ó Baker signaled in his inaugural speech that his proposal would seek to direct at least some additional funding to specific programs or practices such as acceleration academies and after-school programs.

ÒI agree thereÕs a need for more money, but pouring more money into broken systems doesnÕt mean the money will be invested in the right places for the most high-need students,Ó said Marty Walz, a former House chair of the Education Committee who worked on the 1993 law.

Another potential stumbling block is the price tag. The lack of agreement on what the legislation would cost to implement was among the reasons House and Senate negotiators failed to compromise last summer.

Chang-Diaz said estimates of her billÕs cost range from $900 million to $2 billion.

ÒIt depends on exactly how we shape the bill, and it also depends a lot on things that are unknowable to us today, as with any other endeavor of large scale in government or the private sector,Ó she said.

For instance, demographic changes Ñ say, more students for whom English is not their native language Ñ could cause the price tag to climb.

The legislation would give the Legislature flexibility on how quickly to phase in a new funding formula; at the press conference, Chang-Diaz described a range of four to seven years to fully put it in place.

BostonÕs role in the debate is a complicating factor. City officials were not supportive of last yearÕs legislation, but Mayor Martin J. Walsh participated in WednesdayÕs press conference.

ÒItÕs time to put our differences aside. ItÕs time to not have fights about education funding. ItÕs time to get together,Ó Walsh said. ÒThereÕs going to be more than this bill filed, but we need to come together and come up with a bill that works.Ó

Chang-Diaz and her coauthors won the mayorÕs support with several changes, in particular new language that aims to ensure Boston and other municipalities would still receive state aid for their school systems after the state diverts millions earmarked for the city to fund charter schools there. Without changes, Boston in two years is likely to face a situation in which all of its so-called Chapter 70 education aid would go to charter schools, forcing the city to rely on its own revenue to fully fund its school system.

But those changes could very likely raise objections from other players, including some House members who donÕt believe Boston deserves additional aid, given its vast property wealth, among other factors.

Amid all the challenges and complexity, Chang-Diaz pointed to another factor in favor of getting a bill passed.

"Health, Public Safety","Gun discussions, drug treatment on Mayor Walsh's health care agenda","Doctors & Guns in Home, Treatment for Non-Violent Offenders, Healthcare in Underserved Areas",7.7,1/10/19,Jessica Bartlett,Boston Business Journal,5,10,8,"Mayor Martin Walsh's health care priorities for the next two years include getting doctors to help prevent gun violence and expanding access to substance abuse treatment, according to a legislative package unveiled Thursday.

The mayorÕs agenda for the state Legislature include a narrower set of goals compared to the 100 or so bills typically filed by his office in a given year.

ÒI donÕt think itÕs a secret we were disappointed at the amount of work we were able to get done on Beacon Hill (last year),Ó said Joyce Linehan, chief of policy for Walsh. ÒWe think taking this approach weÕll be more successful.Ó

Walsh has recruited a variety of groups to help support his agenda, including the Boston Police Department, Bowdoin Street Health Center, and Massachusetts Immigrant & Refugee Advocacy Coalition. ÒWeÕll be calling on those partners to advocate for these bills as we go through the process,Ó Linehan said.

Here are three of the top goals for health care legislation outlined by his office:

Involving doctors in gun safety: This act would require medical professionals to ask patients about guns in the home, and bring up the topics of gun safety. The goal, Boston Police Commissioner William Gross said, is to identify those at risk for domestic violence, suicide or child access to guns in order to guide people to mental health counseling, resources or other help. ÒWeÕre just asking them to help identify ways to save lives,Ó Gross said.

The fact that a patient owns guns would not be put in their medical record, and is not intended to have physicians help solve crimes. Chief of Health and Human Services Marty Martinez said that while the program is already common practice at many of the cityÕs community health centers, legislation would broaden the program statewide.

Diversion to substance use treatment: The bill would allow individuals facing non-violent, first or second drug offenses to avoid jail time by going to a treatment facility instead. The individual would first be evaluated by a licensed clinician to determine if they are drug-dependent, and likely to benefit from treatment.

While the state already suffers a shortage of beds to treat patients for substance use, Martinez said the bill would work in conjunction with bringing more resources online.

ÒWe see addiction, we know itÕs happening,Ó said Martinez. ÒThere are so many folks that end up on the path toward corrections, and if their path was recovery they would end up in a path toward healing.Ó Reducing barriers for foreign-trained health professionals: The state would study ways to reduce the barriers that foreign-trained health professionals face in trying to secure health care jobs in Massachusetts. According to Eva Millona, executive director of the Massachusetts Immigrant & Refugee Advocacy Coalition, one in five foreign-trained health workers is underemployed or unemployed.

ÒThis is a waste of talent,Ó Millona said. ÒWe havenÕt spent a dime educating them É (We should) make sure those barriers to licensing are addressed in a way it serves our economy.Ó

Martinez said the goal would be to direct resources to understaffed health centers, as well as increase the diversity of the stateÕs health care workforce.

Boston Police Commissioner Gross said the effort would learn from the failures of drug crime processing in the 1990s, which increased rates of incarceration but didnÕt solve the drug problems. While the city already has programs similar to this widely in Suffolk County courtrooms already, passage of the bill would expand similar opportunities to others statewide.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Health, Public Safety",Boston top cop introduces bills to curb gun violence,"Vehicles Transporting Guns, Doctors & Guns in Home",8.7,1/10/19,Taylor Pettaway,Boston Herald,9,9,8,"Aggressive bill proposals backed by Boston police include a measure that would allow cops to impound vehicles found containing illegal firearms or used in drive-by shootings.

Police Commissioner William Gross emphasized during a roundtable talk on Mayor Martin J. WalshÕs new legislative agenda Wednesday the importance of bringing gun violence to the attention of the Legislature, saying since 2014 the Boston Police Department has recovered more than 4,000 weapons off the streets Ñ with officers collecting 11 guns in the first nine days of 2019.

One bill would allow police to fine owners of vehicles impounded due to involvement with illegal guns an estimated $2,000, plus towing and storage fees.

ÒThe motor vehicles are being used as a conduit to help commit crimes, and oftentimes the criminals are utilizing their friends and familyÕs motor vehicles to transport illegal firearms,Ó Gross said.

ÒWe are doing everything we can to prevent and deter the gun violence,Ó he added. ÒMaybe people will think twice.Ó

The money from the fines would fund youth programs to help create a better quality of life, Gross said.

The commissioner also threw his weight behind a bill that would require medical professionals to ask patients about guns in the home during routine questioning to identify red flags that could indicate risks of suicide or violence in the home.

Gross said the bill isnÕt meant to use medical professionals as police agents but rather to help identify ways to save lives.

ÒIt is just to put another tool in the physicianÕs belt to help out the victims,Ó Gross said. ÒWe want to tackle this from all avenues.Ó

In addition, the commissioner also backed a bill to help solve gun crimes by requiring all Massachusetts police to enter ballistics information for every crime into the National Integrated Ballistics Information Network. He said this will help professionals spot patterns in crimes to prioritize investigations.

ÒWe need to be using the technology on hand to solve gun crimes,Ó he said, citing his own use of it during his days as a detective.

Public Safety,Boston proposes state law requiring doctors to ask about guns in homes,Doctors & Guns in Home,9.0,1/10/19,Priyanka Dayal McCluskey and Milton Valencia,Boston Globe,10,9,8,"Health care providers would be required to play a larger role in addressing gun violence, and more drug offenders could receive treatment instead of punishment, as part of legislation that Mayor Martin J. Walsh plans to push on Beacon Hill this year.

Walsh administration officials said Wednesday that they will ask lawmakers to approve a bill requiring doctors to ask patients about guns in their homes to help identify risks of suicide and domestic violence.

ÒThis is a great way for the medical field to help identify any red-flag issues,Ó Boston Police Commissioner William Gross said in a briefing with reporters. ÒItÕs to put another tool in the physicianÕs belt to help out the victims.Ó

Some health care providers already ask patients about their safety, but this kind of screening is not required by law. ÒWeÕve lost a number of patients to gun violence,Ó said Phillomin Laptiste, executive director of Bowdoin Street Health Center in Dorchester.

Laptiste said the health center asks its patients questions such as: ÒDo you feel safe in the home?Ó and ÒAre you being threatened?Ó Depending on their answers, the center connects patients with resources that can help.

Dr. Alain A. Chaoui, president of the Massachusetts Medical Society, said in a statement Wednesday that, Òwhen appropriate, a physician, as part of a detailed conversation about medical history, has a right and responsibility to speak with patients about gun ownership, storage, and safety.Ó

The proposal is part of a broad legislative agenda from the Walsh administration, including several bills focused on health and safety. Earlier this week, the administration laid out legislative priorities related to education, transportation, and housing.

In Massachusetts, state law limits local governmentsÕ ability to make legislative changes on their own. Cities and towns can seek a home-rule petition, which needs state approval, or can file a bill directly with the Legislature for issues that have statewide implications.

Walsh administration officials said they would call for the state to seek appropriate housing Ñ other than emergency homeless shelters Ñ for at-risk youths leaving foster care or juvenile detention centers or who have been incarcerated. Officials said at-risk youths are more likely to improve their living conditions if they are housed in an appropriate environment other than a shelter.

One bill would streamline the application process for those applying for public benefits, such as food stamps. Another would allow people committing nonviolent drug offenses for the first or second time to seek addiction treatment instead of Òa pathway to incarceration,Ó said Marty Martinez, BostonÕs chief of health and human services.

Martinez said the array of bills is meant to Òtackle some real specific things that can make a dent.Ó

The proposed mandate that doctors ask patients about guns was part of a larger package to address firearms. Gross proposed a state law that would levy fines up to $2,000 against the owners of cars that are used to transport illegal weapons. The cars would be impounded until the fines are paid.

Another proposal would require all police agencies in the state to enter information from ballistics evidence into a national database. Many big city departments already do, but Gross said he was surprised to learn that many smaller departments do not. New Jersey and Delaware have similar statewide mandates, he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Education,"Marty Walsh, others again go to bat for higher school funding",PROMISE Act,9.3,1/9/19,James Vaznis,Boston Globe,10,10,8,"The effort to overhaul school funding in the state is expected to receive a big boost Wednesday when Mayor Martin J. Walsh plans to throw his support behind a revamped bill that could provide hundreds of millions of additional dollars to public schools.

The legislation would guarantee a minimum amount of state aid to all school systems statewide Ñ a measure that Walsh unsuccessfully soughtto include last summer in a bill that ultimately ended in a legislative stalemate.

Walsh is scheduled to appear at a State House press conference Wednesday with key legislative leaders, including Senator Sonia Chang-Diaz, a Boston Democrat who cochairs the Joint Education Committee, and other local leaders and advocacy organizations to unveil the legislation, entitled the Promise Act.

The push comes as Brockton and other school systems are contemplating a lawsuit against the state for allegedly failing to live up to its constitutional duty for to fund education adequately, while Governor Charlie Baker vowed this month that he would file his own bill on school funding. ÒYou canÕt shortchange our kids,Ó Walsh said Tuesday during a City Hall media briefing. ÒYou canÕt shortchange educational opportunity.Ó

So far, the measure backed by Walsh and Chang-Diaz, who has been pushing to update the funding formula for the last eight years, appears to have the broadest support.Representatives from the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents, Massachusetts Teachers Association, Massachusetts Association of School Committee, the Boston NAACP, and other organizations are expected to speak at the press conference.

ÒThere are a lot of districts working hard to make magic out of what they have, sort of MacGyvering it out there with some duct tape and spit and making some amazing things happen,Ó Chang-Diaz said.

But, she added, that approach is not sustainable and school districts need financial relief immediately.

The effort to overhaul school funding has been gaining steam since a legislative commission in 2015 found that the stateÕs 26-year-old funding formula had been underestimating the cost of schooling by hundreds of millions of dollars.

The current formula is based on a so-called foundation budget that attempts to predict the cost of educating each districtÕs students and a municipalityÕs ability to pay, weighing such factors as property values, municipal revenue growth, and income levels.

But the formulaÕs inflation mechanism failed to keep pace with the growing cost of education, forcing local communities to shoulder more for employee health insurance, special education, and specialized programs for low-income students and those with language barriers.

The legislative commission recommended revising the cost estimates to reflect true spending levels Ñ a move embraced in the Promise Act.

A legislative fix was making headway on Beacon Hill last summer, with both House and Senate passing their own versions of a school funding bill, but a conference committee was unable to reach a compromise before the legislative session ended.

Walsh at the time expressed concern the bills could potentially leave the Boston school system with even less state aid.

Boston has argued for years that the stateÕs formula penalizes the city for having a large property tax base, strong municipal revenue growth, and spending well above state minimum levels on education.

Making matters worse for Boston, if the state increased the foundation budget levels on which the formula is based, the per-student tuition amounts to charter schools would have gone up, too.

The state covers charter costs by redirecting state aid from a municipality to the charter schools their students attend, and in Boston most state aid already goes to the charters.

In an effort to expand public support, the superintendents association has organized a series of forums, which began Tuesday night in Malden, to advocate for overhauling the school funding formula. Brockton and other districts also have been sponsoring forums.

ÒWe must find ways to expand access to educational opportunities for all our students, teach viable work-related skills, and most importantly, ensure we include students in the bottom of the income bracket,Ó Tom Scott, the associationÕs executive director, said in a statement. ÒThe Massachusetts economy is dependent on all of us to insure all students have the skill set for todayÕs workplace.Ó

Medford Mayor Stephanie Burke and Lawrence Mayor Daniel Rivera joined Walsh on Tuesday to advocate for changing the formula. Burke said superintendents every year are left with the same question Ñ how are we going to pay for education Ñ while often having to make some painful budget cuts.

ÒWe really are just juggling dollars,Ó she said. ÒWe really need the whole team to come together and do what is right for all children in the Commonwealth.Ó",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Education,Superintendents spotlight ed funding formula flaws,PROMISE Act,7.0,1/9/19,Bruce Mohl,Commonwealth Magazine,5,8,8,"PUBLIC SCHOOL superintendents made the case for changing the state funding formula for education at forums in New Bedford, Fitchburg, and Malden on Tuesday as lawmakers on Beacon Hill prepared to roll out legislation addressing the problem.

After the House and Senate failed to agree on school funding legislation at the end of the last session, proponents are pulling out all the stops this year. Sen. Sonia Chang-Diaz, who cochairs the Joint Education Committee, is unveiling what she calls the Promise Act on Wednesday with a supporting cast that includes Boston Mayor Marty Walsh and legislative leaders. But even more compelling are the stories of local school superintendents who say they are barely staying afloat under the current funding formula. The formula, developed in 1993, attempts to provide each school district with a foundation budget reflecting the cost of educating that districtÕs students and the surrounding communityÕs ability to pay. A commission concluded in 2015 that the formula was failing to adequately account for the rising cost of employee health insurance and surging expenses for special education and programs for low-income and English language learners.

At the Fitchburg forum, Brian Allen, the chief financial and operations officer for the Worcester schools, said 10 local districts spent $174 million in 2017 above what the formula estimated was needed to cover just employee health insurance and special education services. School officials said they were running out of places to cut spending to make up the difference.

ÒThereÕs really no where to go from here,Ó said Worcester Schools Superintendent Maureen Binienda.
At the New Bedford forum, officials from Wareham said they had cut 80 school positions over the last eight years while Taunton leaders said they closed schools and moved the superintendentÕs office into an elementary school.

ÒWe canÕt meet the needs of our students,Ó said David Sawyer, the superintendent in Attleboro. ÒThereÕs nowhere left to go.Ó

At the Malden forum, Revere Superintendent Dianne Kelly said the inadequate funding formula creates an equity gap between students in districts without access to additional resources and wealthier districts that can often tap their residents for more money. ÒWeÕve been living on a fixed income since 1993, and that fixed income is not working,Ó said Chelsea Superintendent Mary Bourque. ÒThis is not a sustainable model for funding school systems in our state.Ó
Fixing the formula wonÕt be easy. Many estimate the tab to fix the formula will be more than $1 billion. The House and Senate couldnÕt agree how to address the problem last year, and Gov. Charlie Baker has indicated he will weigh in with his own legislative proposal this year. Communities such as Brockton and Worcester have been watching and waiting for a long time, and leaders in those cities say they may take legal action to fix the formula if policymakers on Beacon Hill fail to act.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Education,Another Push To Revamp School Funding: Will It Pass This Time?,PROMISE Act,7.7,1/9/19,,WBUR,9,9,5,"Here we go again!

State Sen. Sonia Chang-Diaz has again put forward an ambitious bill to increase funding for Massachusetts public schools. Again, a large and vocal coalition has assembled behind it. And yet the new billÕs path to passage remains uncertain, though it does have some powerful new supporters. Last summer, the Jamaica Plain Democrat watched in frustration as a prior incarnation of her ""foundation budget"" bill Ñ which might send $1 billion or more to schools, and which had passed the Senate unanimously Ñ collapsed in conference committee at the bitter end of the legislative session.

The reason for that collapse remains somewhat mysterious, but clearly Chang-DiazÕs bill suffered without the support of Gov. Charlie Baker, House Speaker Robert DeLeo or Boston Mayor Marty Walsh.

This go-round, she says, should be different.

ÒThis is not about three people,Ó Chang-Diaz said, but about securing an unprecedented, bipartisan commitment to common-sense fixes to what she describes as a funding emergency in many of the state's schools.

Then again, Chang-Diaz did announce with pleasure that Mayor Walsh will give his ÒenthusiasticÓ support to the latest incarnation of her bill at a press conference Wednesday morning.

The Situation In Boston

Boston is in an unusual situation when it comes to school funding. Due to its considerable property-tax revenue, the state treats it like an affluent suburb and gives it only the minimum aid, covering (in theory) just 17.5 percent of its school spending.

That being said, Boston educates more than its share of Massachusetts' most vulnerable (and therefore resource-intensive) students. For example, Interim Superintendent Laura Perille highlighted the district's concentration of ""dually identified students"" Ñ students who might have to learn English and contend with learning disabilities or poverty at the same time.

Meanwhile, the city is still losing students Ñ and, therefore, education dollars Ñ to the growing charter school sector. And though the state is supposed to reimburse the district to soften those losses, they have increasingly failed to do so in recent years.

Boston officials say all that adds up to a future that looks untenable: ""More and more of our education aid ... goes right back out the door before Boston ever sees it,"" said the city's budget director, Justin Sterritt.

The city projects that, if nothing changes, it will receive no net state education aid within the next two years Ñ most of it lost to the rising cost of charter schools. Walsh called it ""robbing Peter to pay Paul.""

Boston Backs A Reshaped Bill

So what brought about the change of heart? A change in the bill itself.

""WeÕve put in some bottom-line, safe-harbor provisions to make sure that É money is going to follow [every] student, including the minimum state share that should follow that student,"" Chang-Diaz said.

The new version of the bill introduces a concept of a ""district student aid floor,"" one that city officials said was informed by projections conducted by the Massachusetts Budget and Policy Center. In effect, it would put the state on the hook to help districts like Boston that are seeing their promised aid gobbled up by the cost of charter school tuition.

If you look at the city's ""cherry sheet"" Ñ its account book of state funds Ñ for this fiscal year, officials expect a total of $242 million in education aid and charter reimbursements. But then they expect to send $196 million back out to charter schools. That works out to a net $46 million, around 4 percent of the city's $1.1 billion annual spending on its schools.

The new bill would seek to ensure, in effect, that Boston would get annual increases in state aid so that they continually net, at least, the 17.5 percent aid after all their charter dollars are sent.

That tweak, Sterritt said, would result in a slightly more expensive bill Ñ costing a projected $1.5 billion, as opposed to around $1 to 1.2 billion Ñ but one that will work better for urban districts.

""I'm not anti-charter school,"" Walsh said Tuesday. ""This is about coming up with a formula that works for everybody."" He was flanked by two mayors who agreed: Dan Rivera of Lawrence and Stephanie Burke of Medford.

Rivera, who has overseen Lawrence's climb out of state receivership, said that ""every year, we're taking more money out of our reserves to balance the books on the public school side"" owing to the cost of charter schools and other structural problems.

Both Rivera and Burke supported Chang-Diaz's bill last session, but both asserted that this version represents a step forward for their constituents.

The Second Battle Of Beacon Hill

Last session, Baker largely kept mum about Chang-Diaz's bill.

But as he was inaugurated last week, he spoke out, saying: ""the foundation formula"" Ñ the way the state calculates the minimum cost of education in a district Ñ ""needs to be updated, and weÕll propose updates when our budget is filed later this month.""

Representatives from Baker's office would not comment on what form those updates would take, pending those forthcoming updates. But Baker and some on his staff have suggested that they will look for ways to improve schools' practices alongside the added funding.

In his address, Baker said he would look to offer ""opportunities for under-performing school districts to invest jointly with the Department of Education in proven best practices."" And his secretary of education, Jim Peyser, said in a statement: ""As important as this increased investment is, how much the state spends is ultimately not as important as how well we spend it.""

The governor's framing appeals to Keri Rodrigues, a parent activist who supports school choice, among other causes. Rodrigues says Massachusetts' ""achievement gap"" is so dire Ñ ranking the state 48th in the nation, by some counts Ñ that the state should eschew no-strings-attached spending in favor for targeted reforms designed to close that gap.

In the Chang-Diaz/Walsh proposal, Rodrigues said, ""I don't see a plan. All I see is money Ñ and money without direction. That is irresponsible.""

But that earned pushback from the group congregating behind the new bill, which will be filed Wednesday morning.

Rivera bristled at the notion, put forward by Baker, that Lawrence's recent resurgence under its appointed receiver, Jeff Riley, ""proved"" that reforms like ""acceleration academies"" can turn around educational results on their own.

""In business, there's this thing called a 'proof of concept,' "" Rivera said. ""You gotta do that on a shoestring. But now that stuff works, you gotta pay for it."" Like Walsh, Rivera sold the new spending as an investment in the future of the commonwealth: ""These kids have to be learning at a high level and, frankly, that costs money.""

Chang-Diaz, for her part, described education reform as a ""three-legged stool"": coupling spending with school accountability and choice. She gestured back to the school accountability reforms she supported back in 2010, which expanded charter schools and toughened state oversight of public schools.

""In the past five to ten years, we have really jacked up the legs of the stool having to do with accountability and choice... [and] we have let the leg of the stool having to do with funding shrink,"" Chang-Diaz said.

As to those arguing that schools need yet more reforms in exchange for new spending, she said supporters are ""going to have to make the case for what's wrong with the system that we currently have.""

Walsh agreed, inviting any critics of new, ""no strings attached"" spending to ""come spend a week with the school department and tell me where the reforms are.""

It could be weeks before the governor files his own counter-proposal. But other diverse groups Ñ including pro-charter nonprofits and teachers' unions, not natural allies Ñ are asking for something to be done for public schools' bottom lines, and as soon as possible.

Chang-Diaz hopes this coalition Ñ now a little bigger Ñ will prevent last session's nightmare from becoming a recurring one. Hence the early start on the bill's filing. She said she doesn't want what could be a broad and contentious conversation about the cost of public education to fall apart as the clock strikes midnight.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Transportation,"Walsh agenda focuses on climate change, traffic congestion","TNC Charge, Gas Leaks Fine, Climate-Ready Commission, Regional Transport Ballot Initiatives, Photo Enforcement for Traffic Violations",6.0,1/9/19,Michael P. Norton,Statehouse News Service,1,9,8,"Reaching again for statewide initiatives, Boston Mayor Martin Walsh on Tuesday dumped another bundle of requests on Beacon Hill, making it clear that he wants a say in debates this session over climate change, traffic congestion and infrastructure.

Walsh rolled out a six-bill environmental and transportation agenda and his office said he plans to unveil two more bundles of bills. Walsh on Monday kicked off the week by outlining a wide range of housing and economic security priorities.

Among the asks of Beacon Hill coming up from City Hall are a bill imposing fines on natural gas providers for gas leaks and legislation creating a Commission for a Climate Ready Commonwealth. Walsh is also asking Gov. Charlie Baker and lawmakers to let cities and towns pass taxes to fund local transportation projects, allow the use of cameras to enforce block-the-box and school bus safety violations, allow local option assessments on private parking garage spaces, and alter ride-for-hire laws to lower assessments for shared trips and increase assessments for solo trips.

The city, whose vulnerability to rising sea levels has been exposed, has already committed to being carbon neutral by 2050.

""Addressing the threat of climate change and making sure we keep up with our transportation needs goes beyond city limits. That's why we must work together with the Massachusetts Legislature on issues of climate mitigation and adaptation, and do everything we can to address congestion and increase safety in our streets,"" Walsh said in a statement Tuesday morning. ""I'm proud to propose legislation that will explore incentives to reduce pollution and create a statewide vehicle to work on resiliency projects, as well as proposals that would provide investment in transportation infrastructure.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first of two environmental bills focuses on the MayorÕs plan for a Resilient Boston Harbor to protect against rising sea levels and climate change. It would create a regional commission to determine which entity should lead major coastal and inland resiliency projects, as well as how the projects will be funded and prioritized.

District-level planning for the Downtown and North End neighborhoods, as part of Climate Ready Boston, is expected to start early this year and will include new designs for Christopher Columbus Park, Langone & Puopolo Parks and SargentÕs Wharf. Some district planning has already been completed in places like East Boston, where a deployable flood wall was installed; Charlestown, where part of Main Street will be elevated; and South Boston, where stormwater flood planning is being conducted at Moakley Park.

Most recently the City, in partnership with the Boston Planning and Development Agency (BPDA), submitted its proposal for a $10 million FEMA pre-mitigation grant to begin resilience work along the Fort Point Channel. Learn more about the coastal resilience projects with the CityÕs tracker.

The second environmental bill would impose a fine on natural gas providers for the total volume of all gas leaks, incentivizing the utility companies to update their infrastructure and providing revenue for climate-ready municipal projects.

This bill would accelerate BostonÕs progress toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions, an important task if Boston is going to meet its goal of being carbon neutral by 2050. The City is currently updating its Climate Action Plan to identify immediate steps to take in order to reach this goal.

Mayor Walsh is also proposing four transportation bills that further the goals of Go Boston 2030, which aims to reduce traffic; encourage travel by transit, bike and on foot; and ensure safety and accessibility for all users of BostonÕs streets.

The first bill would allow cities and towns in Massachusetts to pass taxes to fund specific transportation projects. The second, in an effort to promote safer streets, would allow for photo enforcement for school buses with cameras to capture violations when the STOP arm is deployed and for addressing Blocking the Box traffic violations.

The third transportation bill would allow cities and towns to add parking assessments in private parking garages. These funds would then go toward road and bridge maintenance, as well as bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure.

The final bill would update the Transportation Network Company legislation to better align with the StateÕs and CityÕs climate and mobility goals. New assessments would encourage reduced traffic and carbon emissions by carpooling, using public transit, biking or walking.

Economic Mobility,Mayor Walsh to Propose More Liquor Licenses for the Town of Boston,"Liquor Licenses, Earned Income Credit, Tourism Commssion, Community College, CPA, Elderly Tenants",6.3,1/8/19,Jennifer Pacheco,Up To Boston,1,10,8,"Boston Mayor Marty Walsh is gathering his proposals up for the year to come, and in that package is the proposal to expand the number of liquor licenses certain areas of Boston have.

Mayor Walsh is making sure he plays this one safe, and so far, he seems to be doing a good job of it by the looks of the publicÕs response. Walsh knows and understands that heÕll need the state legislature to vote yes on the proposal to increase the liquor licenses throughout the city of Boston. Instead of coming forward with just one or two additional proposals to pitch, Walsh has come up with approximately 13 bill proposals to present. Yes, the expansion of liquor licenses is involved in the pitch, but Walsh will also be discussing matters of economic issues and housing problems in front of the state legislature when the time comes.

According to city officials, this will only be the first of four packages of proposals Walsh and his team plan to submit to Beacon Hill in the near future.

Mayor Walsh and his team are hoping that more liquor licenses are approved, mainly because they think the additional licenses will help out new restaurants and promote economic growth and activity in the areas they are implemented.

In addition to this, Walsh plans to pitch the following ideas:

-          Proposal to raise the stateÕs earned income tax credit

-          Proposal to expand and promote tourism both in the arts and in culture

-          Proposal to initiate the start of tuition-free community college in Boston

-          Proposal to protect the elderly living in housing

-          Proposal to increase revenue for the Community Preservation Act

All in all, Mayor Marty WalshÕs goal is to pass the majority of these proposed bills in the upcoming year. Walsh has stated that if he has the opportunity to do so, he will take it as a win and see to it that the city of Boston will continuously grow for the benefit of itsÕ people and livelihood.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Housing,Boston mayor unveils housing security and economic mobility legislation,"Right to Counsel, Elderly Tenants",7.0,1/8/19,Katie Pyzyk,Smart Cities Dive,3,10,8,"Boston Mayor Martin Walsh announced on Monday a comprehensive housing security and economic mobility legislative package.
The 14-bill package, which he detailed in a Boston Herald Op-Ed, aims to promote equity, opportunity and resilience by ""preserving neighborhoods, stabilizing vulnerable households, supporting small businesses, removing barriers that keep people in poverty [and] providing new pathways to good jobs."" The bills would provide greater protections for low-income residents facing eviction and ensure they have an attorney, in addition to better protecting residents over 75 from eviction, and limiting rent increases of more than 5% a year.
The package is the first of four that Walsh plans to present to the state legislature. Boston has been hit hard by the nation's affordable housing crisis and Walsh has been at the forefront of finding solutions to ease the burden on citizens. The city released a request for proposals for affordable housing projects the city could financially support, adopted short-term rental regulations and established a $10 million private-donor fund to raise money for homelessness mitigation projects. Last year, Walsh was named chair of the U.S. Conference of Mayors' Community Development and Housing committee.

The recent work builds on the Housing a Changing City: Boston 2030 plan the city adopted shortly after Walsh took office four years ago. The plan originally aimed to create 53,000 new housing units by 2030, and last year that was upped to more than 69,000 units.

Areas beyond Boston are feeling the housing squeeze, and 14 neighboring cities and towns created a housing partnership to address common concerns. The difficulty hasn't just remained within the greater Boston area, either. The state of Massachusetts as a whole has a housing crunch and Gov. Charlie Barker has passed a number of housing measures including short-term rental regulations and a $10 million plan to create 135,000 housing units throughout the state by 2025.

Affordability and capacity have been the two hot issues on which housing crisis discussions have focused. But Walsh's legislative package puts an even stronger emphasis on providing equitable housing options. The proposals offer protections not only for low-income residents, but also aging citizens who generally have limited incomes and less ability to adapt to rent increases.

About 20% of Boston's housing units are rent-controlled, states Walsh's Op-Ed, but ""to keep up with demand and keep housing affordable, the answer is clear: we simply need more housing."" Walsh said he submitted the legislative package so Boston could get additional resources from the state to further progress on affordable housing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Environment, Transportation","Marty Walsh zeroes in on traffic, climate change","Climate-Ready Commssion, Gas Leaks Fine, Photo Enforcement for Traffic Violations, TNC Charge",9.0,1/8/19,Brooks Sutherland,Boston Herald,9,10,8,"Mayor Martin J. WalshÕs new legislative agenda on transportation and the environment is calling for carbon reductions, easing traffic and establishing a regional ÒClimate ReadyÓ Commission to address climate change.

The six bill-package was outlined by city officials Monday in the second of four legislative packages the mayor is sending to the state Legislature. Much like his legislative agenda on housing security and economic mobility, WalshÕs transportation and environment package largely addresses issues with statewide impacts.

ÒAddressing the threat of climate change and making sure we keep up with our transportation needs goes beyond city limits,Ó Walsh said in a press release. ÒThatÕs why we must work together with the Massachusetts Legislature on issues of climate mitigation and adaptation.Ó

Among WalshÕs environmental bills is an Act to Establish a Commission for a Climate Ready Commonwealth, which would create a regional commission Òto determine which entity should lead major coastal and inland resiliency projects.Ó

The environmental side also calls for An Act to Modernize our Natural Gas Infrastructure, which would fine natural gas providers based on their total number of gas leaks and encourage utility companies to update their infrastructure.

ÒFor this plan to work at a regional level, thereÕs going to have to be coordination with other municipalities at key points,Ó Chris Cook, the cityÕs chief of environment, energy and open space, told reporters at a press roundtable to rollout WalshÕs agenda.

Reducing congestion and promoting safe streets are listed as WalshÕs focuses on the transportation side of his legislative agenda. To do this, he is promoting an act that would allow photo enforcement on school buses that would capture violations that occur when the bus has its stop arm deployed.

Monitoring Uber and Lyft, and how they are contributing to traffic and health woes, is also included. The cityÕs Chief of Streets, Chris Osgood, said because ridesharing has cut into the MBTA budget, an update on how Uber and Lyft are regulated is called for due to concerns about Òclimate and mobility.Ó",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Environment, Transportation","Walsh pitches new tax on parking garages, solo trips on Uber, Lyft","Assesment for Parking Lots, TNC Charge",9.0,1/8/19,,WCBV,9,10,8,"Boston Mayor Marty Walsh said Tuesday that he'll ask state legislators to consider opening the door to new taxes on private parking garages. He's also suggesting a tax scheme designed to encourage customers of ride share companies like Uber or Lyft to take shared trips instead of riding solo.

The proposals were included in a summary of Walsh's second suite of proposals for state lawmakers, released by City Hall on Tuesday morning. The legislative plans are focused on the environment and transportation. Walsh's first set of proposals, announced Monday, focused on housing and economic issues.

According to the summary, Walsh is suggesting that lawmakers should pass a bill allowing cities and towns to add a tax on spaces within private parking garages. The mayor said the revenue would be used to build and maintain roads, bridges and infrastructure for bicycles and pedestrians.

Walsh's proposal for Transportation Network Carriers would reduce the tax for shared trips and increase the tax for solo passengers, ""to better align it with the state's and city's climate and mobility goals,"" officials said.

The plan would also encourage walking, biking and use of mass transit options, Walsh's team said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Transportation,Mayor Marty Walsh Reportedly Wants to Increase Rideshare Prices,TNC Charge,6.7,1/8/19,Karla Rendon-Alvarez,NECN,7,10,3,"Boston Mayor Marty Walsh is planning to lobby Massachusetts lawmakers to increase the prices for rideshares in the city, according to The Boston Globe.

The Globe reports Walsh wants to increase the prices for Lyft and Uber in an effort to beat BostonÕs traffic. Rideshares currently pay a 20-cent fee for each ride, with 10 cents of that fee going back to the city or town in which the ride took place, five cents returning to the state and the other five towards assisting the taxi industry.

In the past year, Boston collected about $3.5 million from the fees, which were used to rebuild sidewalks, redesign intersections, to expand the Blue Bikes system and to retime transit signals.

BostonÕs chief of streets, Chris Osgood, told the Globe the increased fee should be based on whether or not trips are causing more traffic. Although the city does not have a set fee in mind yet, Osgood suggested increasing the fee to 35 cents.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Transportation,Boston ride-hail fee increase could lead to more money for infrastructure improvements,TNC Charge,7.3,1/8/19,Tom Acitelli,Curbed Boston,3,10,9,"The Walsh administration wants state lawmakers to allow towns and cities such as Boston to increase the fees that ride-hail companies such as Uber and Lyft have to pay per ride.

Currently, the companies pay 20 cents for each ride they complete, with half that fee going to the municipality where the ride originated and the rest split between the state and a fund to aid the conventional taxi industry that the ride-hails have done so much to decimate.

It is unclear what any per-ride fee would be, but it would likely be an increase from the current 20 cents. Even so, itÕs also likely to be on the lower side compared with other cities. New York, for instance, is ready to enforce a per-ride fee of as much as $2.75 in busier parts of Manhattan.

That fee is lower for trips where passengers share the ride-hail. Such an approach is likely to hold with any increased fee in Boston, too, per the GlobeÕs Adam Vaccaro. A higher fee is unlikely to reduce congestion, though. That is because the 2016 law that instituted the 20-cent fee requires the ride-hail companies to pay it and to not pass along the cost to riders. In other words, riders are ostensibly not feeling any pinch from the feeÑand therefore have no incentive to take mass transit, share a ride, bike, walk, etc.

Still, Boston got about $3.5 million from its share of the fee in 2018, the first year those shares were disbursed. Officials say the money went toward infrastructure tweaks such as intersection redesigns, a Bluebikes expansion, and transit signal fixes.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Transportation,Walsh proposes tax increase for ride-sharing companies,TNC Charge,7.7,1/8/19,,7 News Boston,8,10,5,"Mayor Martin J. Walsh is hoping to reduce traffic in Boston by increasing taxes for ride-share companies operating in the city.

Walsh is taking aim at companies like Uber and Lyft, taxing them more when the ride is only for a solo passenger and reducing the tax for shared trips.

ÒOne of the biggest concerns I hear every day is traffic on the streets and congestion on the streets and then another concern we have is the environment,Ó Walsh said. ÒThis is an opportunity for us to raise fees on ride-sharing services that do individual rides to try and encourage cheaper trips if you take the pool.Ó

The law in Massachusetts would prohibit the ride-sharing companies from passing on the fees to consumers.

Drivers of traditional taxis think the tax increase is a good idea because the roads can often be swamped with ride-sharing drivers that are not familiar with the city.

However, Lyft and Uber are not on board. A Lyft spokesperson said they, too, want to reduce congestion, but they believe any extra tax should be added to all cars.

ÒAny proposal to increase fees only on rideshare, neglecting personal and commercial vehicles, could be detrimental to those who rely on Lyft and services like it for affordable and reliable rides,Ó a Lyft spokesperson said.

Uber shared a similar statement, saying, ÒWe support the MayorÕs goal of implementing solutions to address climate change and congestion on our roads. Uber agrees that people should be incentivized to share rides but that all vehiclesÑpersonal cars, delivery trucks, taxis, and UberÑshould pay to use roads.Ó

Some riders who enjoy how easy it is to catch a ride anywhere and everywhere worry the proposed plan could make things less convenient for them.

ÒThereÕs always unintended consequences,Ó one rider said. ÒI canÕt predict whatÕs going to happen.Ó

Part of WalshÕs plan is to allocate the excess money coming in and use it toward environmentally-friendly projects.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Environment,Boston mayor asks state lawmakers to penalize natural gas companies for leaks,Gas Leaks Fine,9.0,1/8/19,,WCBV,9,10,8,"Boston Mayor Marty Walsh's second suite of legislative proposals will include a penalty for natural gas leaks, an issue which resurfaced in public debate during the National Grid union lockout and in the wake of the Merrimack Valley gas disaster.

In an announcement Tuesday morning, Walsh's team summarized the mayor's second set of proposals for lawmakers on Beacon Hill, which are focused on the environment and transportation. The first set of proposals, announced Monday, focused on housing and economic issues.  According to Tuesday's summary, Walsh is suggesting that natural gas companies should be fined by the state for the total volume of all gas leaks. He argues that this will incentivize utility companies to upgrade the state's aging gas infrastructure.

""Gas leaks not only harm the environment but are a public safety issue, public health concern, and financial burden to ratepayers,"" Walsh wrote.

There are thousands of leaks in Boston alone, according to the Home Energy Efficiency Team. In 2017, the organization tracked 11,902 repaired leaks and 15,829 which went unrepaired.

""These emit methane primarily, which is a greenhouse gas that is extremely potent so that the impact on the emissions on the state is basically the equivalent of all of our stores and businesses,"" Audrey Schulman, president of the HEET, told WCVB in September. Walsh said that curbing gas leaks is one step toward making the city carbon-neutral by 2050.

""Addressing the threat of climate change and making sure we keep up with our transportation needs goes beyond city limits. That's why we must work together with the Massachusetts Legislature on issues of climate mitigation and adaptation, and do everything we can to address congestion and increase safety in our streets,"" said Walsh.

Walsh's other environmental legislative proposal would create a regional commission for projects designed to mitigate the threats of climate change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Housing,Mayor Walsh's New Bill Seeks to Protect Elderly Tenants through Rent Control,Elderly Tenants,6.0,1/7/19,,Up To Boston,3,10,5,"Mayor Marty Walsh proposed a bill which has been widely seen as a new rent control measure which could further protect elderly tenants in Boston, but landlords and developers oppose the idea.

In a city brimming with housing complaints from both renters and home owners, Bostonians are ever-cautious when City or State Government officials suggest new legislation. Says MassLandlors' executive director Douglas Quattrochi, ""That sounds like rent control ... Limiting increases is a form of rent control and itÕll create a shortage for people to find a place to live if enacted. When someone gets in through rent control the tenants will never leave.""

But Boston's housing chief Sheila Dillon and mayor Walsh seem to believe their new bill will protect elderly home owners who are at risk of becoming victims of rising rents in Boston.

""WeÕre seeing many elders lose their home and ones that they have been able to enjoy for decades, so we feel very strongly this a very, very vulnerable population that needs to be protected,Ó said Dillon",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Economic Mobility,Walsh to propose boosting number of liquor licenses in Boston,Liquor Licenses,7.7,1/7/19,Catherine Carlock,Boston Business Journal,5,10,8,"Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh will propose an increase in the number of liquor licenses in the city as part of a 14-bill legislative package, the first part of which he plans to submit to the state on Monday.

Walsh will also ask for the state for a hike in its matching contribution to the city for the Community Preservation Act, and plans to seek greater flexibility to adjust the cityÕs ÒlinkageÓ rate for large commercial developments.

The first of four packages the city intends to submit to the commonwealth focuses on housing security, economic and workforce development. 

ÒBoston and the commonwealth succeed when everyone has a chance to move forward,Ó Walsh said in a statement. 

ÒHousing and economic mobility are linked: a stable home allows residents to pursue opportunities. In Boston, weÕve increased our affordable housing goals and worked to ensure everyone has a home in our city. We are doubling down on economic mobility by supporting small businesses, many of them owned by women, immigrants and people of color, reforming parts of the system that create barriers that keep people in poverty, and providing new pathways to good jobs.Ó

The first step will be taken Monday when Walsh files ÒAn Act to Further Leverage Commercial Development to Build Housing and Create Jobs,Ó which would allow the city to adjust its linkage formula annually instead of once every three years. Real-estate developers currently pay linkage funds at a rate of $9.03 per square foot for housing developments larger than 100,000 square feet.

Another housing-focused bill would request the state boost its matching contribution to BostonÕs Community Preservation Act up from 19 percent. Boston voters in 2016 approved the CPA, a 1 percent surcharge on property taxes that goes toward affordable housing, open space and historic preservation. The surcharge generates $20 million annually for the city.

ÒThis bill would increase the fees on recording deeds to ensure a much larger state match,Ó said Sheila Dillon, the cityÕs chief of housing and director of neighborhood development. ÒWe would certainly like to get the match up closer to 50 percent.Ó 

The ÒAct to Create Economic Vitality in Boston NeighborhoodsÓ aims to expand the number of liquor licenses throughout the city and target them to specific neighborhoods that could use an infusion of economic activity generated by restaurants. The city currently has 1,188 active liquor licenses, of which 812 are all-alcohol and 376 are wine and malt, or beer, licenses. 

WalshÕs bill would create an umbrella license for developments spanning 750,000 square feet or more, with 125,000 square feet of commercial/retail space, in an effort to free up licenses for individual neighborhood spots. 

Other legislative proposals include a pitch to broaden the cityÕs tuition-free community college program to the entire commonwealth, a bill that would give rental tenant associations the right of first refusal to purchase properties for fair market value, and a bill that would prohibit no-fault eviction for people ages 75 and older. 

ÒUntil we have enough affordable housing for everyone, we need to make sure that residents of Boston are protected and that they can stay in their homes,Ó Dillon said.  ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Housing,Affordable housing funds could get boost from developers under Walsh plan,Linkage/IDP,9.3,1/7/19,Tim Logan,Boston Globe,10,10,8,"Boston could soon require developers of office space and hotels to contribute more money to affordable housing funds, if Mayor Martin J. Walsh gets his way. ItÕs one item on a lengthy wish list he plans to file with state lawmakers this month.

The Walsh administration says it will ask the Legislature for more flexibility on so-called linkage rules, which require commercial developers to help fund affordable housing and job training, with an eye toward increasing those requirements to help create more low-cost apartments.

ÒWeÕve been hearing from housing advocates loud and clear that linkage needs to be increased,Ó said Joyce Linehan, WalshÕs chief of policy.

The fees Ñ currently $9.03 per square foot for housing and $1.78 for job training Ñ generated more than $31 million from 2014 through 2018 and were increased just last year, for the first time since 2013. Given the often-lengthy legislative process, any further increase is likely to be at least a year away, and city officials donÕt have a target amount in mind, they said. Under current state law, Boston can increase the fees once every three years, at a rate tied to inflation. WalshÕs proposal would do away with those limits, making it easier for the city to adapt to the market, said John Barros, his chief of economic development.

ÒWe need the flexibility to work with the ebbs and flows of the economy,Ó Barros said. ÒThose are the kinds of things weÕre trying to achieve with this legislation.Ó

In Massachusetts, state laws hinder local governmentsÕ ability to act in a variety of arenas. Home-rule petitions Ñ in which a town meeting or city council asks state approval to change a law Ñ are routine and often pass easily on minor matters. But the process can be complex when it comes to controversial or complex issues. Last session, Walsh filed a slate of proposed renter protections, known as the Jim Brooks Act, that fizzled in the Legislature.

In the session now getting underway, he plans to file 15 bills on housing, job training, and economic development alone. TheyÕre a mix of home-rule petitions and proposed statewide legislation.

Other bills coming out of City Hall will include measures to add more than 150 liquor licenses across the city, increasing state funding for the Community Preservation Act, making BostonÕs tuition-free community college program available statewide, and protecting older renters in the city from eviction. Walsh also plans to roll out bills covering education, transportation, and health and safety.

Some of the measures have been proposed before and have gone nowhere. Linehan said the administration hopes to build strong coalitions this time Ñ often including other cities and towns Ñ to push them through.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
Housing,Marty Walsh to file elderly tenant protection bill to state lawmakers,Elderly Tenants,9.0,1/7/19,Jonathan Ng,Boston Herald,9,10,8,"Property owners are gearing up for a fight against what they say is a return of rent control as Mayor Martin J. Walsh files legislation heÕs touting as a way to protect elderly renters in the city.

If passed, the legislation prepared by Walsh would Òlimit rent increases to 5 percent per year to prevent landlords from using large rent increases to get around just cause protections,Ó according to a description of the proposal.

ÒThat sounds like rent control,Ó said Douglas Quattrochi, executive director of MassLandlords, an organization that represents over 1,400 landlords in the state. ÒLimiting increases is a form of rent control and itÕll create a shortage for people to find a place to live if enacted. When someone gets in through rent control the tenants will never leave.Ó

The Walsh Administration defended the proposal.

ÒWeÕre seeing many elders lose their home and ones that they have been able to enjoy for decades,Ó said Sheila Dillon, the cityÕs housing chief. ÒSo we feel very strongly  this a very, very vulnerable population that needs to be protected.Ó

The proposal would protect senior tenants 75 years or older against Òarbitrary, unreasonable, discriminator, or and retaliatory evictions.Ó  If passed, the law would only allow eviction for cases such as failure to pay rent or damage to the property.

ÒThe lead-up to to these draft bills the last months to three months, weÕre sitting down with the affordable housing advocates, the jobs folk and really figuring out what is most important and what we think we can get passed,Ó said Dillon. ÒIÕm feeling very optimistic that weÕve developed reasonable, rational, well-thought through bills.Ó

Quattrochi however said the proposal was not developed with input from the property owners that he represents.

ÒWe were not invited to the room on these discussions,Ó said Quattrochi. He added that any form of rent control would Ògalvanize the landlordsÓ to oppose it.

Kathy Brown, executive director at Boston Tenant Coalition, a nonprofit that promotes affordable housing and expanding the rights of tenants said renters, who make up the majority of Boston residents, need protection. ÒRent protection is the number one thing that is said at every community meeting when talking about housing crisis and families impacted by it,Ó said Brown.

ÒBostonÕs approach in this in this legislative package is twofold,Ó said Dillon. ÒWe really do need to generate additional resources for the creation of affordable housing and weÕve been doing an admirable job adding to our affordable housing stock but the Mayor, and all of us, will say that until we have enough affordable housing for for everyone, we need to make sure that residents of Boston are protected and they can stay in their homes. ThatÕs the bottom line.Ó",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Walsh's ""housing security and economic mobility"" package includes legislation to allow the city to make changes to the program linking commercial developments to housing production, prohibit no-fault evictions for people older than 75, and expand the number of liquor licenses for the city. Walsh's legislative bundle also includes bills that would require all companies with more than 100 employees to report the gender and race of certain managers to a new public state database, and to require the state to consider an employer's record of violations of health and safety standards, wage laws, civil rights laws and more before awarding a contract.

Also among the 14 bills Walsh announced are a handful with a statewide focus, including a bill to increase the deeds fees that fund the Community Preservation Trust Fund, legislation to essentially make Boston's tuition-free community college program available statewide, a bill to further expand the Earned Income Tax Credit, and a proposal to establish a statewide Commission on Tourism and Arts and Culture Investment.

The mayor's office said Walsh's agenda ""serves all people of Massachusetts through its focus on equity and opportunity, ensuring Boston and Massachusetts' growth benefits all communities in the Commonwealth.""

""Boston and the Commonwealth succeed when everyone has a chance to move forward,"" Walsh, a former state representative who is often mentioned as a future candidate for higher office, said in a statement.

Walsh is proposing a statewide replica of Boston's Tuition-Free Community College (TFCC) program, which currently serves 295 Boston students attending Bunker Hill, Roxbury or MassBay community colleges. Walsh's office said the program's students have a graduation rate of 70 percent.

The mayor is also pitching the elimination of a state cap on welfare benefits for families who have another child while already receiving public assistance. Last year, the state Legislature passed legislation to lift the cap on benefits but it was vetoed by Gov. Charlie Baker, who said he does not oppose lifting the cap but wanted it tied to changes to the way transitional aid to families with dependent children is calculated.

The Campaign to Lift the Cap on Kids said a family of three with no other income receives $593 a month in welfare benefits but would receive just $491 if one of the children is excluded by the existing state cap.

""We thank Mayor Walsh for recognizing that economic mobility has to start with meeting children's basic needs,"" Deborah Harris of the Massachusetts Law Reform Institute said in a statement. ""We hope the Legislature will move quickly to Lift the Cap on Kids Ñ again Ñ so children do not have to wait even longer for a clean diaper or winter boots.""

On the housing front, Walsh is asking the state to sign off on allowing the city to formalize programs that generate affordable housing or funding towards affordable housing from commercial or residential developments. He is also seeking to provide certain low-income tenants who are facing eviction with a court-appointed attorney and to provide some tenant associations with the right of first refusal to purchase residential rental properties at fair market value.

The mayor's office said the housing-related bills expand upon ""the work that Boston has done to address the region's affordable housing crisis and proposing new and existing tools to leverage Boston's prosperity and create sustainable wealth opportunities for a more inclusive and equitable city.""

""Strengthening tools like the Inclusionary Development Program and Linkage to ensure that Boston will be able to build income-restricted housing in the future represents great forward-thinking,"" Association of Community Development Corporations President and CEO Joe Kreisberg said in a statement released by Walsh's office. ""We'd like to see more cities and towns utilize these tools to build more affordable housing in their communities, and to adopt the needed tenant protections the package offers to the Commonwealth's most vulnerable households.""

Walsh's office did not respond Monday to a News Service request for copies of the 14 bills the mayor announced he would file. His office said the package is the first of four the mayor plans to file.

Two years ago, Walsh announced that his state legislative agenda was to focus on measures to prevent the displacement of Boston residents by expanding tenants' rights, rewarding good landlords, and creating additional funding for affordable housing, and on ""comprehensive education finance reform.""

After being unable to reach an agreement to adjust the education funding formula last session, the topic is again on the legislative agenda this year, and Walsh is expected to join advocates, educators and state lawmakers Wednesday to promote legislation to reform the formula.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In a statement, Walsh said, ""Housing and economic mobility are linked: a stable home allows residents to pursue opportunities.""

The first of four parts filed Monday includes a bill that would allow the city to change its linkage rate Ð that's the fee charged to large developers and used for affordable housing projects - to every year instead of once every three years. 

""Boston as a city is extremely segregated. And one of the ways that we can ensure thereÕs more affordable housing and that weÕre looking at those residential patterns is by creating more opportunities for more affordable housing to be built,"" said housing activist Beya Jimenez. 

Jimenez says it's a huge victory for renters paying more than $2,300 a month for a one bedroom and over a half million or more on a single-family home.

""Housing is no longer just a city issue. It's a statewide issue and therefore we need to look at ways that we can all work together,"" said Jimenez.
Three bills in the package are aimed at tenants protections, giving tenant associations the right of first refusal to purchase properties for fair market and prohibits no-fault evictions for people 75 and older. 

The Small Property OwnerÕs association tells Boston 25 News reporter Crystal Haynes that Walsh's bill is illegal saying:

""It's a rent control bill. It's illegal under state law. It's vote-pandering. This will hurt small property owners. There are hundreds of stories of profoundly hideous abuses of the systems.""

In an effort to boost the cityÕs economy, the number of liquor licenses would be expanded with the creation of umbrella licenses for larger multi-unit commercial developments. Walsh is also looking to broaden the cityÕs tuition-free community college program. 

But Jimenez cautions enforcement of these bills needs to include those they are supposed to benefit.

"Housing, Economic Mobility","Mayor Walsh's 2019 agenda includes additional liquor licenses, housing reforms","Liquor Licenses, Earned Income Credit, Tourism Commssion, Community College, CPA, Elderly Tenants",9.0,1/7/19,,WCBV,9,10,8,"Boston Mayor Marty Walsh's package of legislative proposals for 2019 includes an expansion of the number of liquor licenses in targeted neighborhoods.

Because increasing the number of liquor licenses requires approval from the state legislature, Walsh's pitch is included along with 13 other bills focused on economic and housing issues. City officials said this package is the first of four sets of bills Walsh's team plans to submit to Beacon Hill.

According to a summary of the proposal, the city asserts that additional liquor licenses would benefit new restaurants and drive economic activity.

""Restaurants are the lifeblood of neighborhood business districts, providing jobs and gathering spaces, and spurring other businesses to locate nearby, and this balanced approach to licensing ensures neighborhoods historically disadvantaged by the liquor license process will receive their fair share,"" Walsh wrote in an announcement of the proposal. 

Walsh's other economic proposals include plans to raise the state's earned income tax credit, create a statewide system to promote tourism in arts and culture and to create a statewide version of Boston's tuition-free community college initiative.

Housing proposals include bills that would provide protections for elderly tenants and increase state revenue for the Community Preservation Act.

""Housing and economic mobility are linked: a stable home allows residents to pursue opportunities. In Boston, we've increased our affordable housing goals and worked to ensure everyone has a home in our city,"" Walsh said.

""I look forward to advancing these bills in the Legislature, and creating more opportunity for all,"" he said.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
All,Expanding opportunity key to initiatives,"Linkage/IDP, CPA, Right to Counsel, Elderly Tenants, Community College, Liquor Licenses,",9.7,1/6/19,MJW,Boston Herald,9,10,10,"My goal as Mayor of Boston is to expand opportunity for all our residents. Over the last five years, weÕve worked hard to ensure that everyone has access to quality schools, good jobs, and a safe and secure home. WeÕve come a long way, and weÕve set ambitious goals to take this work even further Ñ weÕve increased our affordable housing goals, created a regional housing partnership with leaders around Greater Boston, and dedicated over $100 million to build and maintain affordable housing in Boston. And weÕre going to do more.

To continue this work, Monday IÕm unveiling the first of four legislative packages to Beacon Hill, starting with housing security and economic mobility. The 14-bill package shows how we can promote equity, opportunity and resilience by preserving neighborhoods, stabilizing vulnerable households, supporting small businesses, removing barriers that keep people in poverty, providing new pathways to good jobs and continuing to leverage BostonÕs prosperity to build a more inclusive and equitable city.

To understand how these bills would continue to expand opportunity for people in Boston and the Commonwealth, itÕs important to know how far weÕve come and what challenges remain.

For years, housing costs have been a big challenge for people in our communities and across the country. Many families struggle to pay their rent, and first-time homebuyers face major obstacles. ThatÕs why weÕve tackled this issue head-on: by increasing our affordable housing goals and working hard to make sure that everyone in our city has a place to call home. WeÕve doubled down on economic mobility by supporting small businesses, many of them owned by women, immigrants and people of color. WeÕre reforming parts of the system that create barriers and keep people in poverty. And weÕre providing new pathways into good jobs.

About one in five housing units in Boston is income-restricted, meaning itÕs set aside for people with lower incomes. WeÕre proud to be a national leader in this regard. But in order to keep up with demand and keep housing affordable, the answer is clear: we simply need more housing. Last year we increased our housing goals from 53,000 to 69,000 new units by 2030. We worked with mayors from around Greater Boston to create a regional housing production goal of 185,000 new units of housing across the greater Boston area by the year 2030.

To continue this work and build momentum, we need additional tools and resources from the state. ThatÕs where our legislative package comes in.

Our bills would allow Boston to secure more money to build affordable housing and secure the funding that we extract from private developers.  For example, when developers begin new projects in Boston, weÕll ask them to include affordable units, or pay into a fund for affordable housing production in the city. With our new bills, weÕll be able to do this work more effectively.  We will also support a bill that will increase the state match on local funding raised from the Community Preservation Act.

While we continue to build affordable housing, we must work to protect our most vulnerable residents.  Our bills will create more protections for low income residents who are facing eviction, ensuring them an attorney if they canÕt afford one. In addition, we are proposing that residents over 75 years of age are protected from evictions by limiting no-fault evictions and rent increases of more than 5% a year.

Finally, our bills would ensure that renters whose landlords are selling their apartments or homes have the Òright of first refusalÓ. That means renters, or their designees, can offer to buy their homes first, at fair market value, if itÕs put on the market by the landlord.

These common sense solutions will help protect Boston residents and allow them to remain in the communities they love. We must continue to increase affordable housing in Boston while we provide common sense protections for low income and older Bostonians.

ThatÕs why addressing the cost of renting, buying and living in our city is our top priority. To stay a world-class city, we need to offer affordable homes for the working families that make our our city and our neighborhoods the special places they are. I look forward to submitting our housing package to the legislature to ensure Boston remains a city that works for all of our residents and families.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
